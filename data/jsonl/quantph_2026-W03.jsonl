Unlike classical systems, however, identical quantum circuits may exhibit substantially different behavior across devices due to architectural variations in qubit connectivity, gate fidelity, and coherence times.   In this work, we systematically benchmark five representative quantum algorithms - Bell state preparation, GHZ state generation, Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), Grover's Search, and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) - across trapped-ion, superconducting, and simulator backends using Amazon Braket. Performance metrics including fidelity, CHSH violation, success probability, circuit depth, and gate counts are evaluated.   Our results demonstrate a strong dependence of algorithmic performance on hardware topology and noise characteristics. For example, 10-qubit GHZ states achieved fidelities above 0.8 on trapped-ion hardware, while superconducting platforms dropped below 0.15 due to routing overhead and accumulated two-qubit gate errors.

Yet their practical usefulness and performance depend critically on reliability, quantified by the noise-to-signal ratios (NSRs), i.e., normalized fluctuations of work and power, where reliability decreases inversely with increasing NSR. We establish fundamental limits to this reliability: both work and power NSRs are universally bounded from below by a function of charging speed, imposing a reliability limit inherent to any quantum battery. More strikingly, we find that a quantum mechanical uncertainty relation forbids the simultaneous suppression of work and power fluctuations, revealing a fundamental trade-off that also limits the reliability of quantum batteries. We analyze the trade-off and limits, as well as their scaling behavior, across parallel (local), collective {(fully non-local)}, and hybrid (semi-local) charging schemes for many-body quantum batteries, finding that increasing power by exploiting stronger entanglement comes at the cost of diminished reliability of power. Similar trends are also observed in the charging of quantum batteries utilizing transverse Ising-like interactions. These suggest that achieving both high power and reliability require neither parallel nor collective charging, but a hybrid charging scheme with an intermediate range of interactions.

We analyze the production of entropy in an exactly solvable model of a quantum wire wherein the conserved flow of entropy under unitary quantum evolution is taken into account using an exact formula for the entropy current of a system of independent quantum particles. In this exact microscopic description of the quantum dynamics, the entropy production due to Joule heating does not arise automatically.

Because the gate complexity of the block-encoding subroutine largely determines the overall cost of QSVT-based algorithms, developing new and more efficient block encodings is crucial for achieving practical quantum advantage. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for constructing quantum circuits that block encode linear combinations of Pauli strings. Our approach relies on two key components. First, we apply a transformation that converts the Pauli strings into pairwise anti-commuting ones, making the transformed linear combination unitary and thus directly implementable as a quantum circuit. Second, we employ a correction transformation based on the stabilizer formalism which uses an ancilla register to restore the original Pauli strings. Our method can be implemented with an ancilla register whose size scales logarithmically with the number of system qubits. It can also be extended to larger ancilla registers, which can substantially reduce the overall quantum circuit complexity. We present four concrete examples and use numerical simulations to compare our method's circuit complexity with that of the Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) approach.

Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of atomic gases have been an ideal platform for studying many-body quantum phenomena, such as superfluidity, and simultaneously providing an opportunity to broaden our understanding of classical hydrodynamics into quantum systems. In this review, we introduce a range of experimental studies on the pattern formation in quantum fluids of atomic gases under external driving, including Faraday waves in one and two dimensions, surface patterns, and counterflow instabilities in a mixture of superfluids. The pattern formation in the quantum system can be understood through the parametric amplification process, where an unstable dynamical mode can be exponentially amplified, similar to classical systems. Remarkably, the governing equations for surface excitations of trapped BECs can be mathematically equivalent to those of shallow water, indicating a universal description of the hydrodynamic instability across classical and quantum domains. However, the condensates, as superfluids, also possess fundamental quantum characteristics, such as quantized vorticity and a distinct dissipation channel. These unique features showcase many-body fragmentation under strong modulation and the generation of vortices in the nonlinear regime, which could offer a pathway to the study of quantum turbulence.

Using ancillary qubits we show that this algorithm allows approximating general Lindbladians as well. For interacting dephasing Lindbladians coupling two subsystems, we develop a decoupling scheme that reduces the circuit complexity of the simulation. This is achieved by sampling from a time-correlated probability distribution - determined by the evolution of one subsystem, which specifies the stochastic circuit implemented on the complementary subsystem. We demonstrate our approach by studying a model of bosons coupled to fermions via dephasing, which naturally arises from anharmonic effects in an electron-phonon system coupled to a bath.

This also provides a link between the graphical representation of pure Gaussian states and an explicit expression for the QFI in terms of graphical parameters.

Previous works that achieve these guarantees and provide modularity necessary to optimization of protocols to real-world hardware are most often expressed in the Measurement-Based Quantum Computation (MBQC) model. This leaves architectures based on the circuit model -- in particular those using the Magic State Injection (MSI) -- with fewer options to verify their computations or with the need to compile their circuits in MBQC leading to overheads.   This paper introduces a family of noise robust, composable and efficient verification protocols for Clifford + MSI circuits that are secure against arbitrary malicious behavior. This family contains the verification protocol of Broadbent (ToC, 2018), extends its security guarantees while also bridging the modularity gap between MBQC and circuit-based protocols, and reducing quantum communication costs. As a result, it opens the prospect of rapid implementation for near-term quantum devices.   Our technique is based on a refined notion of blindness, called magic-blindness, which hides only the injected magic states -- the sole source of non-Clifford computational power. This enables verification by randomly interleaving computation rounds with classically simulable, magic-free test rounds, leading to a trap-based framework for verification. As a result, circuit-based quantum verification attains the same level of security and robustness previously known only in MBQC.

In contrast, whether a direct temperature readout can be achieved in quantum thermometry remains largely unexplored, particularly under the nonequilibrium conditions prevalent in real-world applications. To address this, we develop a direct temperature readout scheme based on a thermodynamic inference strategy. The scheme integrates two conceptual developments: (i) By applying the maximum entropy principle with the thermometer's mean energy as a constraint, we assign a reference temperature to the nonequilibrium thermometer. We demonstrate that this reference temperature outperforms a commonly used effective temperature defined through equilibrium analogy. (ii) We obtain positive semi-definite error functions that lower-bound the deviation of the reference temperature from the true temperature-in analogy to the quantum Cramer-Rao bound for the mean squared error-and vanish upon thermalization with the sample. Combining the reference temperature with these error functions, we introduce a notion of corrected dynamical temperature which furnishes a postprocessed temperature readout under nonequilibrium conditions.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a family of sub-symmetric witnesses (SSWs), which are tractable both theoretically and experimentally. Analytically, we establish a connection between SSWs and the cut space of graph theory, enabling several powerful detection criteria tailored to practical quantum networks. Numerically, we show that the optimal detection can be formulated as a linear program, offering a significant efficiency advantage over the semidefinite programs commonly employed in quantum certification. Experimentally, SSWs can be evaluated via local measurements, with resource requirements independent of the local dimension in general, and even independent of the overall network size in many practical networks.", "primary_category": "quant-ph", "categories": ["quant-ph"], "published": "2026-01-12T11:19:00Z", "updated": "2026-01-12T11:19:00Z", "abs_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07427v1", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.07427v1.pdf"}

The present work provides a detailed computational and theoretical study investigating the source of such discrepancy. Electronic spectroscopy data are calculated by time-dependent density function theory and then compared with experimental results. Electronic couplings between exciton donor and acceptor are estimated based on both transition density cube method and transition dipole approximation. These results confirm that the delocalization of exciton to the bridge parts contribute to significant enhancement of donor-acceptor electronic coupling. Mechanistic details of exciton transfer are examined by estimating the contributions of the bridge electronic states, vibrational modes of the dyads commonly coupled to both donor and acceptor, inelastic resonance energy transfer mechanism, and dark exciton states. These analyses suggest that the contribution of common vibrational modes serves as the main source of deviation from Förster's spectral overlap expression.", "primary_category": "physics.chem-ph", "categories": ["physics.chem-ph", "cond-mat.mtrl-sci", "quant-ph"], "published": "2026-01-08T02:07:04Z", "updated": "2026-01-08T02:07:04Z", "abs_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06190v1", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.06190v1.pdf"}

Along with these developments, challenges and opportunities exist in the field of Quantum Software Engineering, as the development of frameworks and higher-level abstractions has attracted practitioners from diverse backgrounds. Unlike initial quantum frameworks based on the circuit model, recent frameworks and libraries leverage higher-level abstractions for creating quantum programs. This paper presents an empirical study of 985 Jupyter Notebooks from 80 open-source projects to investigate how quantum patterns are applied in practice. Our work involved two main stages. First, we built a knowledge base from three quantum computing frameworks (Qiskit, PennyLane, and Classiq). This process led us to identify and document 9 new patterns that refine and extend the existing quantum computing pattern catalog. Second, we developed a reusable semantic search tool to automatically detect these patterns across our large-scale dataset, providing a practitioner-focused analysis. Our results show that developers use patterns in three levels: from foundational circuit utilities, to common algorithmic primitives (e.g., Amplitude Amplification), up to domain-specific applications for finance and optimization.

From this perspective, low-rank parameterizations naturally correspond to low-dimensional Matrix Product States (MPS) representations, which enable entanglement-based characterizations of parameter structure. Thereby, we term and measure \"Artificial Entanglement\", defined as the entanglement entropy of the parameters in artificial neural networks (in particular the LLMs). We first study the representative low-rank adaptation (LoRA) PEFT method, alongside full fine-tuning (FFT), using LLaMA models at the 1B and 8B scales trained on the Tulu3 and OpenThoughts3 datasets, and uncover: (i) Internal artificial entanglement in the updates of query and value projection matrices in LoRA follows a volume law with a central suppression (termed as the \"Entanglement Valley\"), which is sensitive to hyper-parameters and is distinct from that in FFT; (ii) External artificial entanglement in attention matrices, corresponding to token-token correlations in representation space, follows an area law with logarithmic corrections and remains robust to LoRA hyper-parameters and training steps. Drawing a parallel to the No-Hair Theorem in black hole physics, we propose that although LoRA and FFT induce distinct internal entanglement signatures, such differences do not manifest in the attention outputs, suggesting a \"no-hair\" property that results in the effectiveness of low rank updates.

These currents arise from the interference between the one- and two-photon transitions. Here, we will show that photoelectron spin detection already reveals enantio-sensitive multi-polar currents in the one-photon regime since the two axes can be marked by the photoelectron momentum $\\unitvec{k}$ and spin-detection axis $\\unitvec{s}$. Specifically, we consider one-photon ionization of an isotropic ensemble of randomly oriented chiral molecules and show that the direction of the resulting photoelectron current is enantio-sensitively `locked' to the photoelectron's spin, which is mediated by two mechanisms.

To address this, we introduce a new paradigm of deep thermalisation for mixed states, fundamentally distinct from that for pure-state ensembles. In our formulation, the deep thermal ensemble arises by tracing out auxiliary degrees of freedom from a maximum-entropy ensemble defined on an augmented system, with the ensemble structure depending explicitly on the entropy of the initial state.

We apply a measure of quantum state complexity for n-qubit systems, defined as the divergence between the Shannon or von Neumann entropy of the computational basis distribution and the second-order Renyi entropy. This quantity has already been used earlier termed as structural entropy and it is particularly powerful as the Renyi entropy is directly related to state purity, linear entropy, and the inverse participation ratio, providing a clear physical grounding. While other Renyi orders could be used, the second order offers a deep and established connection to these key physical quantities. We first validate the measure in canonical noise channels, showing it peaks at the boundary between quantum and classical regimes. We then demonstrate its power in many-body physics. For systems exhibiting a many-body localization transition - including deformed random matrix ensembles and a disordered Heisenberg spin chain - the complexity measure reliably signals the crossover from integrable/localized to quantum-chaotic/ergodic phases. Crucially, the maximum complexity occurs in the non-ergodic yet extended states at the transition, precisely capturing the critical region where the system is neither fully localized nor thermalized. Furthermore, within the chaotic phase, the measure correlates with the survival probability of local excitations, revealing a spectrum of thermalization properties.

Traditionally, this capability is measured by the entangling power (EP), defined as the average entanglement generated when a quantum operation acts uniformly on all possible product states. However, EP alone cannot capture the intricate input-state-dependent nature of entanglement generation. To address this, we define a complementary metric -- entangling power deviation (EPD) -- as the standard deviation of entanglement generated over all product input states, thereby capturing the multifaceted nature of entangling behavior. We develop a general group-theoretical framework that yields closed-form expressions for both EP and EPD. Our analysis shows that any nontrivial entangling operation necessarily exhibits input-state dependence: nonzero EP implies a nonzero EPD. By analyzing representative two-qubit gates, we show that the gates with identical EP can exhibit markedly different EPD values, illustrating that the nature of entanglement generation can significantly differ depending on the gate functionality. Extending our framework to a class of generalized controlled-unitary operations acting on bipartite Hilbert spaces of arbitrary dimensions, we further analyze the interplay between the entangling strength and uniformity, as quantified by EP and EPD.

This formalism permits gradient estimation via an adjoint-state method, facilitating efficient learning of quantum dynamics, and other dynamics that can be mapped (relatively easily) to quantum dynamics. Using this method, we present quantum algorithms for computing gradients with and without time discretisation, achieving efficient gradient computation that would otherwise be intractable on classical devices. We provide detailed resource estimates for these algorithms and investigate the local energy landscape for training. The formalism subsumes a wide array of applications, including quantum state preparation, Hamiltonian learning, learning dynamics in open systems, and the learning of both autonomous and non-autonomous classical ODEs and PDEs. In many cases of interest, the Hamiltonian is composed of a relatively small number of local operators, yet the corresponding classical simulation remains inefficient, making quantum approaches advantageous for gradient estimation.

The key idea is to represent ``deliberation'' as a coherent iterative branching process, in which competing branch-dependent system evolutions are maintained in superposition, with additional control and memory registers recording branch histories, and the policy register adaptively biasing subsequent development. We provide explicit quantum circuit realizations and carry out detailed step-by-step derivations of the entangled control--memory--system--policy dynamics. We carefully distinguish between internally adaptive and internally reinforced deliberations, proposing the architectures for both, and briefly discuss categorical and controlled--Stinespring reformulations, as well as their conceptual implications. The primary construction models a memory-driven deliberation where the policy update depends on which actions were taken, not on their results. We also present a simple extension that allows for minimalistic, outcome-driven policy updates, implementing a coherent feedback loop that steers the system toward a target state regardless of initial branch-dependent evolution. This loop can be interpreted as a quantum autopilot or search-and-rescue mechanism, illustrating how a device can autonomously correct and optimize its internal strategy in superposition. Finally, we briefly consider various implementations of a dialogue that may take place between two deliberating machines.

To circumvent these constraints, we propose the Enhanced Single-Photon Detection (ESPD) framework, which shifts the photon-detection paradigm from device-centric optimization to an integrated quantum-information-processing (QIP) task. By incorporating state preparation, controlled operations, projective measurements, and multi-copy decision analysis, we establish a nonlinear dynamical model that reformulates detection as an iteratively enhanced process.

By introducing tolerance to fabrication defects into the design of the quantum devices, we can improve the yield of usable quantum chips and lower the cost of useful systems. Automated Compilation Including Dropouts (ACID) is a framework that works in the ancilla-free (or `middle-out') paradigm, to generate syndrome extraction circuits for general stabiliser codes in the presence of defective couplers or qubits. In the ancilla-free paradigm, we do not designate particular qubits as measurement ancillas, instead measuring stabilisers using any of the data qubits in their support. This approach leads to a great deal of flexibility in how syndrome extraction circuits can be implemented. ACID works by constructing and solving an optimisation problem within the ancilla-free paradigm to find a short syndrome extraction circuit. Applied to the surface code, ACID produces syndrome-extraction circuits of depth between $1\\times$ (no overhead) and $1.5\\times$ relative to the depth of defect-free circuits. The LUCI algorithm, the best prior art, yielded a $2 \\times$ overhead, so ACID offers a significant time saving.

However, these techniques do not fully capture the behavior of driven circuits stimulated by external microwave drives, nor do they include a generalized approach to account for the inevitable noise and dissipation that enter through microwave ports. Here, we introduce novel numerical techniques that leverage classical microwave simulations that can be efficiently executed in finite element solvers, to obtain the time-dependent Hamiltonian of a microwave-driven superconducting circuit with arbitrary geometries. Importantly, our techniques do not rely on a lumped-element description of the superconducting circuit, in contrast to previous approaches to tackling this problem.

The maximum thickness is evaluated for which the nanomembrane undergoes a change in curvature: from concave to convex with respect to the plate, due to the Casimir interaction. The Casimir energy for a curved surface is derived using the Proximity Force Approximation (PFA) with next-to-leading-order (NTLO) corrections. Kirchhoff-Love theory for a thin isotropic plate of constant thickness is used to estimate the bending energy. Material-dependent effects on the Casimir interaction are evaluated by comparing Au and Ag plates.

Results show curvature reversal occurs for nanomembranes with nanoscale thicknesses at the studied distances.

By solving the Schrödinger equation asymptotically, we derive two expansions of the wave function when three bosons are far apart or a pair of bosons and the third boson are far apart. The scattering hypervolume $D$ is defined for this collision. Unlike the scattering hypervolume defined by one of us in 2008, whose dimension is length to the fourth power, the dimension of $D$ studied in the present paper is length to the eighth power. We then derive the expression of $D$ when the interaction potentials are weak, using the Born's expansion. We also calculate the energy shift of such three bosons with three different momenta $\\hbar \\mathbf{k_{1}}$, $\\hbar\\mathbf{k_{2}}$ and $\\hbar\\mathbf{k_{3}}$ in a large periodic box. The obtained energy shift depends on $D^{(0)}/Ω^{2}$ and $D/Ω^{2}$, where $D^{(0)}$ is the three-body scattering hypervolume defined for the three-body $L=0$ collision and $Ω$ is the volume of the periodic box. We also calculate the contribution of $D$ to the three-body T-matrix element for low-energy collisions. We then calculate the shift of the energy and the three-body recombination rate due to $D^{(0)}$ and $D$ in the dilute homogeneous Bose gas.

We analyze the spin ladder Hamiltonian in two complementary situations, the strong rung coupling limit and the weak rung coupling limit. In the strong rung coupling limit, we systematically construct effective spin-1/2 chain models, connecting the well-studied one-dimensional spin models and providing a recipe for Hamiltonian engineering. It is worth emphasizing that effective DM interactions can be completely turned off while the microscopic DM interactions are generically inevitable. Moreover, the staggered DM interactions, which are not possible in the microscopic spin model, can also be realized in the effective spin-1/2 model.

Deterministic-stochastic dualities are available in principle, and arise in a non-contrived way in many scientifically important models. When dynamical systems admit mathematically equivalent deterministic and stochastic formulations, their observable predictions depend only on the induced structure of correlations between preparations and measurement outcomes. I use this model-equivalence to motivate a model-invariance criterion for ontological commitment, according to which only structural features that remain stable across empirically equivalent representations, and whose physical effects are invariant under such reformulations, are candidates for realism. This yields a fallibilist form of structural realism grounded in modal robustness rather than in the specifics of any given mathematical representation. Features such as conservation laws, symmetries, and causal or metric structure satisfy this criterion and can be encoded in observable relations in mathematically intelligible ways. By contrast, the localisation of modal selection -- whether in initial conditions, stochastic outcomes, or informational collapse mechanisms -- is not invariant under empirically equivalent reformulations and is therefore best understood as a gauge choice rather than an ontological feature. The resulting framework explains how certain long-standing problems in the foundations of physics, including the measurement problem and the perceived conflict between physical determinism and free agency, arise from the reification of representational artefacts.

Despite recent research efforts, existing QFL frameworks struggle to achieve optimal model training performance primarily due to inherent heterogeneity in terms of (i) quantum noise where current quantum devices are subject to varying levels of noise due to varying device quality and susceptibility to quantum decoherence, and (ii) heterogeneous data distributions where data across participating quantum devices are naturally non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID). To address these challenges, we propose a novel integrated sporadic-personalized approach called SPQFL that simultaneously handles quantum noise and data heterogeneity in a single QFL framework. It is featured in two key aspects: (i) for quantum noise heterogeneity, we introduce a notion of sporadic learning to tackle quantum noise heterogeneity across quantum devices, and (ii) for quantum data heterogeneity, we implement personalized learning through model regularization to mitigate overfitting during local training on non-IID quantum data distributions, thereby enhancing the convergence of the global model. Moreover, we conduct a rigorous convergence analysis for the proposed SPQFL framework, with both sporadic and personalized learning considerations. Theoretical findings reveal that the upper bound of the SPQFL algorithm is strongly influenced by both the number of quantum devices and the number of quantum noise measurements. Extensive simulation results in real-world datasets also illustrate that the proposed SPQFL approach yields significant improvements in terms of training performance and convergence stability compared to the state-of-the-art methods.", "primary_category": "quant-ph", "categories": ["quant-ph", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "published": "2026-01-11T23:29:08Z", "updated": "2026-01-11T23:29:08Z", "abs_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07882v1", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.07882v1.pdf"}

We use Weyl's definition of gravitational radius of charge to obtain the fine-structure constant for non-integrable scale effects $α_S$. The minuteness of $α_S$ relative to $α$ ($α_S/α\\sim 10^{-21}$) effectively hides the effects in usual quantum experiments. In an Aharonov-Bohm double-slit experiment, the theory predicts that the position probability density depends on which slit the particle trajectory crosses, due to a non-integrable scale induced by the magnetic flux. This experimental prediction can be realistically tested for an electrically neutral, heavy molecule with mass $m \\sim 10^{-19} \\text{g}$ at a $\\sim 10^6 \\text{ esu}$ flux regime. We analyse the Weyl-Einstein debate on the second-clock effect using the theory and show that spectral frequencies are history-independent. We thereby resolve Einstein's key objection against local scale invariance, and obtain two further experimental predictions. First, spectral intensities turn out to be history-dependent. Second, energy eigenvalues are modified by tiny imaginary corrections that modify spectral linewidths.

Originally proposed to bypass the limitations imposed by von Neumann's theorem on the impossibility of hidden-variable models in quantum mechanics, it faced strong opposition from the outset. Over time, however, its use in tackling specific problems across various branches of physics has led to a gradual shift in attitude, turning the early resistance into a more moderate acceptance. A plausible explanation for this change may be that, since the late 1990s and early 2000s, Bohmian mechanics has been taking on a more operational and practical role. The original hidden-variable idea has gradually faded from its framework, giving way to a more pragmatic approach that treats it as a suitable analytical and computational tool. This discussion explores how and why such a shift in perspective has occurred and, therefore, answers questions such as whether Bohmian mechanics should be considered once and for all a legitimate quantum representation (i.e., worth being taught in elementary quantum mechanics courses) or, by extension, whether these ideas can be transferred to and benefit other fields.

Here we show that this assumption can be violated on contemporary hardware, with direct implications for the interpretation of observed Bell violations. We introduce an ensemble-divergence framework in which slow temporal drift of the preparation process induces context-dependent effective ensembles, even when measurement independence and locality are preserved. This leads to a relaxed Bell bound $|S| \\le 2 + 6δ_{\\mathrm{ens}}$, where $δ_{\\mathrm{ens}}$ quantifies preparation nonstationarity. Because $δ_{\\mathrm{ens}}$ is not directly observable, we develop an operational witness $δ_{\\mathrm{op}}$ based on bin-resolved outcome statistics for fixed measurement channels. Using Pauli-axis measurements on IBM superconducting processors, we observe statistically significant operational drift that persists after full two-qubit readout mitigation, ruling out measurement artifacts.

This approach increases resource utilization and mitigates initialization latency while maintaining result fidelity. Currently, state-of-the-art compilers for neutral atom architectures do not support multi-programming.   To fill this gap, we introduce MultiQ, the first system designed for this purpose.

These projectors can then be coherently applied as state filters prior to quantum phase estimation (QPE). We analyze their asymptotic gate complexities for explicit circuit realizations. For the particle number and $S_z$ symmetries, GQSP offers favorable resource usage features owing to its low ancilla qubit requirements and robustness to finite precision rotation gate synthesis.

Numerical simulations show that symmetry filtering substantially increases the QPE success probability, leading to a lower overall cost compared to that of unfiltered approaches across representative molecular systems. Resource estimates further indicate that the cost of symmetry filtering is $3$ to $4$ orders of magnitude lower than that of the subsequent phase estimation step This advantage is especially relevant in large, strongly correlated systems, such as FeMoco, a standard strongly correlated open-shell benchmark.

The QFI serves as an upper bound on the classical Fisher information (CFI), representing the maximum extractable information about the unknown parameter from measurements on a physical system. Thus, a central goal in quantum parameter estimation is to find a measurement, described by a POVM, that saturates the QFI (achieves maximum CFI), and thereby achieves the QCRB. In the idealization that one uses pure states and unitary encodings for sensing, discontinuities can appear in the CFI but not the QFI.

In this study, we propose a QA-in-the-loop kernel learning framework that integrates QA not merely as a substitute for Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling but as a component that directly determines the learned kernel for regression. Based on Bochner's theorem, a shift-invariant kernel is represented as an expectation over a spectral distribution, and random Fourier features (RFF) approximate the kernel by sampling frequencies. We model the spectral distribution with a (multi-layer) restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), generate discrete RBM samples using QA, and map them to continuous frequencies via a Gaussian--Bernoulli transformation. Using the resulting RFF, we construct a data-adaptive kernel and perform Nadaraya--Watson (NW) regression. Because the RFF approximation based on $\\cos(\\bmω^{\\top}Δ\\bm{x})$ can yield small negative values and cancellation across neighbors, the Nadaraya--Watson denominator $\\sum_j k_{ij}$ may become close to zero. We therefore employ nonnegative squared-kernel weights $w_{ij}=k(\\bm{x}_i,\\bm{x}_j)^2$, which also enhances the contrast of kernel weights.

Most existing approaches aim to recover noiseless circuit outputs from noisy ones through error mitigation or correction. Here, we show that noisy quantum devices can be directly leveraged as computational resources to enhance the classical simulation of quantum circuits. We introduce the Noisy-device-enhanced Classical Simulation (NDE-CS) protocol, which improves stabilizer-based classical Monte Carlo simulation methods by incorporating data obtained from noisy quantum hardware. Specifically, NDE-CS uses noisy executions of a target circuit together with noisy Clifford circuits to learn how the target circuit can be expressed in terms of Clifford circuits under realistic noise. The same learned relation can then be reused in the noiseless Clifford limit, enabling accurate estimation of ideal expectation values with substantially reduced sampling cost. Numerical simulations on Trotterized Ising circuits demonstrate that NDE-CS achieves orders-of-magnitude reductions in sampling cost compared to the underlying purely classical Monte Carlo approaches from which it is derived, while maintaining the same accuracy. We also compare NDE-CS with Sparse Pauli Dynamics (SPD), a powerful classical framework capable of simulating quantum circuits at previously inaccessible scales, and provide an example where the cost of SPD scales exponentially with system size, while NDE-CS scales much more favorably. These results establish NDE-CS as a scalable hybrid simulation approach for quantum circuits, where noise can be harnessed as a computational asset.", "primary_category": "quant-ph", "categories": ["quant-ph"], "published": "2026-01-13T18:01:46Z", "updated": "2026-01-13T18:01:46Z", "abs_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08772v1", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.08772v1.pdf"}

In particular, when performed on logical qubits encoded in physical photonic qubits, they allow for a read-out of stabilizer syndrome information to enhance loss tolerance in qubit-state transmission and fusion. However, even in an ideal setting without photon loss, BMs cannot be done perfectly based on the simplest experimental toolbox of linear optics. Here we demonstrate that any logical BM on stabilizer codes can always be mapped onto a single physical BM perfomed on any qubit pair from the two codes. As a necessary condition for the success of a logical BM, this provides a general upper bound on its success probability, especially ruling out the possibility that the stabilizer information obtainable from only partially succeeding, physical linear-optics BMs could be combined into the full logical stabilizer information. We formulate sufficient criteria to find schemes for which a single successful BM on the physical level will always allow to obtain the full logical information by suitably adapting the subsequent physical measurements. Our approach based on stabilizer group theory is generally applicable to any stabilizer code, which we demonstrate for quantum parity, five-qubit, standard and rotated planar surface, tree, and seven-qubit Steane codes.

It is well known that, in this classical setting, increasing the girth of the Tanner graph while maintaining regular degree distributions leads simultaneously to good belief-propagation (BP) decoding performance and large minimum distance. In the quantum setting, however, this principle does not directly apply because quantum LDPC codes must satisfy additional orthogonality constraints between their parity-check matrices. When one enforces both orthogonality and regularity in a straightforward manner, the girth is typically reduced and the minimum distance becomes structurally upper bounded.   In this work, we overcome this limitation by using permutation matrices with controlled commutativity and by restricting the orthogonality constraints to only the necessary parts of the construction, while preserving regular check-matrix structures. This design breaks the conventional trade-off between orthogonality, regularity, girth, and minimum distance, allowing us to construct quantum LDPC codes with large girth and without the usual distance upper bounds. As a concrete demonstration, we construct a girth-8, (3,12)-regular $[[9216,4612, \\leq 48]]$ quantum LDPC code and show that, under BP decoding combined with a low-complexity post-processing algorithm, it achieves a frame error rate as low as $10^{-8}$ on the depolarizing channel with error probability $4 \\%$.", "primary_category": "quant-ph", "categories": ["quant-ph", "cs.IT"], "published": "2026-01-13T18:57:43Z", "updated": "2026-01-13T18:57:43Z", "abs_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08824v1", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.08824v1.pdf"}

To investigate this possibility and obtain a better understanding of two central postulates of QM, namely the commutator postulate and the Born postulate, we introduce a classical probabilistic theoretical framework which is more general than QM and contains QM as a special case. We call this framework the General Incompatible Variables (GIV) theory, and we show that not only QM systems but also any probabilistic systems (classical or quantal) that possess incompatible variables will exhibit the quantal properties of uncertainty and interference, and we illustrate this with a roulette-like classical system (which we call the Arrow) that shows precisely these properties. We show that QM emerges naturally from the GIV framework when the fundamental variables are taken to be symmetries, so that the incompatibility of the QM variables is actually just the incompatibility of the corresponding symmetries (or their generators). Specifically, when the variables are taken to be the elements of the Poincare group (the symmetry of spacetime) we find that the commutator postulate and the Born postulate follow automatically, and are therefore no longer postulates.

On the classical side, the chosen periodic trajectories are such that all spins instantaneously point in the same direction, which evolves as a function of time. We find that the largest Lyapunov exponents characterising the stabillity of these trajectories have surprisingly strong and nontrivial dependencies on the interaction constants and chain lengths. In particular, we identify rather long spin chains, where the above periodic trajectories are Lyapunov-stable on many-body energy shells overwhelmingly dominated by chaotic motion. We also find that instabilities around periodic trajectories in modestly large spin chains develop into a transient nearly quasiperiodic non-ergodic regime. In some cases, the lifetime of this regime is extremely long, which we interpret as a manifestation of Arnold diffusion in the vicinity of integrable dynamics. On the quantum side, we numerically investigate the dynamics of quantum states starting with all spins initially pointing in the same direction: these are the quantum counterparts of the initial conditions for the above periodic classical trajectories. Our investigation reveals the existence of quantum many-body scars for numerically accessible finite chains of spins 3/2 and higher.

Our framework absorbs the discrete phase space of a qudit into a hybrid phase space parameterizable entirely by the continuous variables of a harmonic oscillator. The unit cell of a hybrid quantum lattice grows with the qudit dimension, yielding a way to simultaneously measure an arbitrarily large range of non-commuting position and momentum displacements. Simple hybrid states can be obtained by applying a conditional displacement to a Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) state and a Pauli eigenstate, or by encoding some of the physical qudits of a stabilizer state into a GKP code. The states' oscillator-qudit entanglement cannot be generated using symplectic (i.e., Gaussian-Clifford) operations, distinguishing them as a resource from tensor products of oscillator and qudit stabilizer states.   Simple hybrid codes can be thought of as subsystem GKP codes whose gauge factor is entangled with a qudit. Our numerical investigations suggest that such codes can sometimes outperform GKP codes against physical noise, and their decoders can be tuned to accommodate either more qudit or more oscillator errors. We also relate stabilizer codes to non-commutative tori, identifying that a general construction of such tori yields multi-mode multi-qudit extensions of GKP codes.

Previously, the only known feasibility result for classical obfuscation of quantum circuits (Bartusek and Malavolta, ITCS 2022) was limited to circuits that always reject. On the other hand, if the obfuscator is allowed to compile the quantum circuit $Q$ into a quantum state $|\\hat{Q}\\rangle$, there exist feasibility results for obfuscating all pseudo-deterministic quantum circuits (Bartusek, Kitagawa, Nishimaki and Yamakawa, STOC 2023, Bartusek, Brakerski and Vaikuntanathan, STOC 2024), and all unitaries (Huang and Tang, FOCS 2025).   We show that (relative to a classical oracle) there exists a classical obfuscator for all pseudo-deterministic quantum circuits. We do this by giving the first construction of a compact quantum fully-homomorphic encryption (QFHE) scheme that supports public verification of (pseudo-deterministic) quantum evaluation, relative to a classical oracle.   To construct our QFHE scheme, we improve on the approach of Bartusek, Kitagawa, Nishimaki and Yamakawa (STOC 2023), which required ciphertexts that are both quantum and non-compact due to the use of quantum coset states and their publicly-verifiable properties. We introduce new techniques for analyzing coset states that can be generated ''on the fly'', by proving new cryptographic properties of the one-shot signature scheme of Shmueli and Zhandry (CRYPTO 2025).

We show that this robustness originates from boundary zero singular modes (ZSMs) of Toeplitz $K$ matrices revealed by singular value decomposition (SVD), rather than from the eigenvalue zero modes responsible for previously known Toeplitz braiding of anyons. We analytically and numerically study representative i$BF$ theories with Hatano-Nelson-type and non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger--type $K$ matrices, establishing a universal correspondence between ZSMs and Toeplitz particle-loop braiding. Our results identify boundary zero singular modes as the mechanism behind Toeplitz particle-loop braiding and establish infinite-component $BF$ theory as a predictive framework for higher-dimensional fracton topological orders.", "primary_category": "cond-mat.str-el", "categories": ["cond-mat.str-el", "cond-mat.mes-hall", "hep-th", "quant-ph"], "published": "2025-11-12T13:12:12Z", "updated": "2026-01-13T12:49:15Z", "abs_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09301v2", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09301v2.pdf"}

A central open problem is whether an obfuscation scheme for arbitrary quantum circuits exists.

Although unitary transformations already include a broad class of quantum computation, many important quantum tasks, such as state preparation and quantum error-correction, go beyond unitaries and fall within general completely positive trace-preserving maps.   In this work, we construct the first quantum ideal obfuscation scheme for arbitrary quantum circuits that support quantum inputs and outputs in the classical oracle model assuming post-quantum one-way functions, thereby resolving an open problem posed in Bartusek et al.

An spsPRU is a family of efficient unitaries that fix every vector in a given linear subspace $S$, while acting as a Haar random unitary on the orthogonal complement $S^\\perp$ under both forward and inverse oracle queries.

Using both mixed quantum-classical simulations and analytical analysis, we reveal that phonon-induced upper-to-lower polariton relaxation proceeds via two steps: the first step is a vertical inter-band transition from the upper to the lower polariton, which is followed by a second step that is a phonon-induced Fröhlich scattering within the lower polariton. We find that in materials of finite thickness (which include filled cavities), phonon-induced polaritonic intraband Fröhlich scattering is significantly suppressed.

A key obstacle to its broader use is that existing convergence guarantees typically rely on analytical conditions that are either overly restrictive or difficult to verify for concrete problems. We address this issue by introducing an a posteriori certification viewpoint: instead of requiring fully a priori verifiable assumptions, we provide convergence and error guarantees that can be validated directly from the iterates produced by the algorithm. Specifically, we prove a generalized global convergence theorem showing that, under convexity and a substantially weaker numerically verifiable condition, the QAB iteration converges to the global minimizer. This theorem yields a practical certification procedure: by checking explicit inequalities along the computed trajectory, one can certify global optimality and bound the suboptimality of the obtained value. As an application, we develop a certified iterative scheme for computing the quantum relative entropy of channels, a fundamental measure of distinguishability in quantum dynamics. This quantity is notoriously challenging to evaluate numerically: gradient-based methods are impeded by the complexity of matrix functions such as square roots and logarithms, while recent semidefinite programming approaches can become computationally and memory intensive at high precision.

Assumptions on locality and related structural properties also underlie recently proposed procedures for learning an unknown Hamiltonian from access to the induced time evolution. However, no protocols to rigorously test whether an unknown Hamiltonian is local were known. We investigate Hamiltonian locality testing as a property testing problem, where the task is to determine whether an unknown $n$-qubit Hamiltonian $H$ is $k$-local or $\\varepsilon$-far from all $k$-local Hamiltonians, given access to the time evolution along $H$. First, we emphasize the importance of the chosen distance measure: With respect to the operator norm, a worst-case distance measure, incoherent quantum locality testers require $\\tildeΩ(2^n)$ many time evolution queries and an expected total evolution time of $\\tildeΩ(2^n / \\varepsilon)$, and even coherent testers need $Ω(2^{n/2})$ many queries and $Ω(2^{n/2}/\\varepsilon)$ total evolution time. In contrast, when distances are measured according to the normalized Frobenius norm, corresponding to an average-case distance, we give a sample-, time-, and computationally efficient incoherent Hamiltonian locality testing algorithm based on randomized measurements. In fact, our procedure can be used to simultaneously test a wide class of Hamiltonian properties beyond locality. Finally, we prove that learning a general Hamiltonian remains exponentially hard with this average-case distance, thereby establishing an exponential separation between Hamiltonian testing and learning.

A major limitation in improving qubit readout is measurement-induced transitions, also referred to as qubit ionization, caused by multiphoton qubit-resonator excitation occurring at specific photon numbers. Since ionization can involve highly excited states, it has been predicted that in transmons -- the most widely used superconducting qubit -- the photon number at which measurement-induced transitions occur is gate charge dependent. This dependence is expected to persist deep in the transmon regime where the qubit frequency is gate charge insensitive. We experimentally confirm this prediction by characterizing measurement-induced transitions with increasing resonator photon population while actively stabilizing the transmon's gate charge.

However, we point out that the efficiency of MPF in the system size $N$ is not exactly resolved yet in that the present error bound expressed by nested commutators is incompatible with the size-efficient complexity reflecting the commutator scaling. The problem is that $q$-fold nested commutators with arbitrarily large $q$ are involved in their requirement and error bound. The benefit of commutator scaling by locality is absent, and the cost efficient in $N$ becomes prohibited in general. In this paper, we show an alternative commutator-scaling error of MPF and derive its size-efficient cost properly inheriting the advantage in Trotterization. The requirement and the error bound in our analysis, derived by techniques from the Floquet-Magnus expansion, have a certain truncation order in the nested commutators and can fully exploit the locality.

The T-junction symmetry nominally present in these resonator devices provides an avenue for the elimination of Fano asymmetry using calibrated measurement. We show that the eigenvalue associated with the common mode excitation of the resonator is an effective reflection mode (ERM) which has no Fano asymmetry.

However, the complex interplay between the quantum strings cannot be well analyzed due to the limited system size in real quantum simulators. Here, with the help of a newly developed quantum Monte Carlo method, we can simulate a larger-scale Kagome Rydberg atom array, providing an ideal playground for studying quantum strings. By introducing a novel edge pinning method, the ends of a quantum string can be attached to edges so that the flexible manipulation of the quantum string becomes possible. Due to the geometric constraint, the quantum strings are unidirectional, which strongly complicates their interplay. To quantitatively describe the quantum string, we built a one-dimensional effective model. With both analytic and numerical methods, rich physics can be found, including ``geometric breaking\", heart-like superposition state of quantum strings, and the attractive inter-string interactions.

Its magnitude depends on the conductivity of the objects up to optical frequencies. Measuring the Casimir force in superconductors should allow to isolate frequency-specific contributions to the Casimir effect, as frequencies below the superconducting gap energy are expected to contribute differently than those above it. There is significant interest in this contribution as it is suspected to contribute to an unexplained discrepancy between predictions and measurements of the Casimir force between normal metals, which questions the basic principles on which estimates of the magnitude are based. Here, we observe the Casimir force between superconducting objects through the nonlinear dynamics it imparts to a superconducting drum resonator in a microwave optomechanical system. There is excellent agreement between the experiment and the Casimir force magnitude computed for this device across three orders of magnitude of displacement. Furthermore, the Casimir nonlinearity is intense enough that, with a modified design, this device type should operate in the single-phonon nonlinear regime.

In this work, we generalize the eta-pairing theory to non-Hermitian Hubbard models on arbitrary lattices and find many novel phenomena without Hermitian analogs. For instance, the Hermitian conjugate of an eta-pairing eigenoperator may not be an eigenoperator, eta-pairing eigenoperators can be spatially modulated, and the $SU(2)$ pseudospin symmetry may not be possible even if $H$ commutes with the eta-pairing operators. Remarkably, these novel non-Hermitian phenomena are closely related to each other by several theorems we establish and can lead to, for example, new types of eta-pairing operators (e.g., the notion of non-Hermitian angular-momentum operators) and the anomalous localization (e.g., the skin effect) of eta-pairing eigenstates. Some issues on the $SO(4)$ and particle-hole symmetries are clarified. Our general eta-pairing theory also reveals a previously unnoticed unification of these symmetries of the Hubbard model. To exemplify these findings, we first propose the Hatano-Nelson-Hubbard model. In this interacting non-Hermitian system without even the bulk translation invariance, the right and left two-particle eta-pairing eigenstates are exponentially localized at opposite boundaries of the chain. Then, we generalize this model to two dimensions and find that the eta-pairing eigenstates can exhibit the first- or second-order skin effect. Finally, a general two-sublattice model is constructed to realize all of the non-Hermitian eta-pairing phenomena.
