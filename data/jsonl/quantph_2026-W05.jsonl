In this work, we study logical T-gate magic-state preparation in GKP-encoded photonic qubits using a repeat-until-success injection protocol combined with outer surface-code protection. We develop an architecture-level modeling framework based on a lightweight density-matrix simulator implemented with standard numerical linear algebra. Finite squeezing is mapped to effective logical dephasing, depolarizing noise is included at the logical level, and photon loss is treated as a heralded erasure process. This approach avoids explicit continuous-variable wavefunction simulation, hardware-specific photonic models, and quantum software frameworks, enabling transparent and computationally efficient exploration of architectural trade-offs. We perform systematic parameter sweeps over squeezing values from 8 to 16 dB, baseline loss probabilities between 0.01 and 0.03, and surface-code distances d = 1, 3, 5, and 7. Across this regime, we evaluate repeat-until-success probability, average injection overhead, and logical magic-state fidelity. We find that success probabilities exceed 0.94 across all studied parameters, with an average overhead close to unity. After outer-code protection, logical fidelities reach approximately 0.77 to 0.80 and show weak sensitivity to moderate photon loss but a strong dependence on squeezing. Phase-boundary analysis identifies minimum squeezing requirements needed to simultaneously achieve high success probability and logical fidelity.

To address this, we introduce a general framework for approximating the cumulative effect of gate-dependent noise using a global depolarizing channel. We specify the regime in which this approximation provides a reliable description of the noisy dynamics. Applying our framework to the thermodynamical two-sort algorithmic cooling (TSAC) protocol, we analytically derive its asymptotic cooling limit in the presence of noise.

Inspired by analogous concepts in quantum state discrimination, we introduce the unambiguous randomness of a quantum state and measurement, and, relaxing the assumption of perfect accuracy, randomness with a fixed rate of inconclusive outcomes. We solve these problems for any state and projective measurement in dimension two, as well as for an isotropically noisy state measured in an unbiased basis of any dimension. In the latter case, we find that, given a fixed amount of total noise, an eavesdropper correlated only to the noisy state is always outperformed by an eavesdropper with joint correlations to both a noisy state and a noisy measurement.

We propose a subspace-confined QAOA tailored to CBRS multi-channel allocation, in which each node-wise channel register is initialized in a Generalized Dicke state and evolved under an intra-register XY mixer. This ansatz confines the dynamics to a tensor product of Johnson graphs that exactly encode per-node Hamming-weight constraints.

Existing training approaches largely rely on gradient-based procedural optimization, which often suffers from slow convergence, sensitivity to hyperparameters, and instability near sharp minima. In this work, we propose an alternative inverse-probability algebraic learning framework for QNNs. Instead of updating parameters through incremental gradient descent, our method treats learning as a local inverse problem in probability space, directly mapping discrepancies between predicted and target Born-rule probabilities to parameter corrections via a pseudo-inverse of the Jacobian. This algebraic update is covariant, does not require learning-rate tuning, and enables rapid movement toward the vicinity of a loss minimum in a single step. We systematically compare the proposed method with gradient descent and Adam optimization in both regression and classification tasks using a teacher-student QNN benchmark. Our results show that algebraic learning converges significantly faster, escapes loss plateaus, and achieves lower final errors. Under finite-shot sampling, the method exhibits near-optimal error scaling, while remaining robust against intrinsic hardware noise such as dephasing.

In this work, we give an efficiently implementable discrete-time counterpart to any continuous-time quantum Gibbs sampler. Our construction preserves the desirable features (i)-(iii) while does not decrease the spectral gap. Also, we give an alternative highly coherent quantum generalization of detailed balanced dynamics that resembles another physically derived master equation, and propose a smooth interpolation between this and earlier constructions. Moreover, we show how to make earlier Metropolis-style Gibbs samplers (which estimate energies both before and after jumps) exactly detailed balanced. We study generic properties of all constructions, including the uniqueness of the fixed point, the (quasi-)locality of the resulting operators. Finally, we prove that the spectral gap of our new highly coherent Gibbs sampler is constant at high temperatures, thereby it mixes fast. We hope that our systematic approach to quantum Glauber and Metropolis dynamics will lead to widespread applications in various domains.", "primary_category": "quant-ph", "categories": ["quant-ph", "cs.DS"], "published": "2024-05-30T17:57:04Z", "updated": "2026-01-23T16:20:45Z", "abs_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20322v2", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.20322v2.pdf"}

In chaotic dynamics, projected ensembles exhibit universal statistics governed by maximum-entropy principles, known as deep thermalization. At infinite temperature this universality is characterized by Haar-random ensembles. More generally, physical constraints such as finite temperature or conservation laws lead to Scrooge ensembles, which are maximally entropic distributions of pure states consistent with these constraints. Here we introduce Scrooge $k$-designs, which approximate Scrooge ensembles, and use this framework to sharpen the conditions under which Scrooge-like behavior emerges. We first show that global Scrooge designs arise from long-time chaotic unitary dynamics alone, without measurements. Second, we show that measuring a complementary subsystem of a scrambled global state drawn from a global Scrooge $2k$-design induces a local Scrooge $k$-design. Third, we show that a local Scrooge $k$-design arises from an arbitrary entangled state when the complementary system is measured in a scrambled basis induced by a unitary drawn from a Haar $2k$-design. These results show that the resources required to generate approximate Scrooge ensembles scale only with the desired degree of approximation, enabling efficient implementations.

Here we show that a phase space theory previously developed to capture electronic momentum and model vibrational circular dichroism -- and which we have postulated should also describe the Einstein-de Haas effect, a macroscopic manifestation of angular momentum conservation -- is also able to recover the $Λ$-doubling energy splitting (or $Λ$-splitting) of the NO molecule nearly quantitatively.

Such descriptions, however, correspond to the singular physical limit of vanishing environmental memory. Here we formulate decoherence using a general time-nonlocal decoherence functional determined solely by the environmental force correlation function, with Markovian dynamics recovered explicitly as a limiting case.   For arbitrary stationary environments with finite temporal correlations, we show that the decoherence functional exhibits quadratic short-time growth that is model-independent within the finite-memory class considered. Consequently, the decoherence time defined operationally-without assuming exponential decay-scales as the square root of the environmental correlation time, independent of the detailed form of the bath correlation kernel.   These results are illustrated analytically for Gaussian-correlated, soft power-law, and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck environments. In the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck case, the non-Markovian dynamics admit an exact analytical closure, yielding a closed evolution equation for the coherence. Exact numerical simulations based on a pseudomode mapping confirm the predicted scaling and show that exponential decoherence emerges only in the memoryless limit.   Beyond coherence decay, we distinguish decoherence rates from observable loss of quantum signatures by analyzing purity and von Neumann entropy dynamics. We show that suppression of a specific coherence element need not coincide with irreversible entropy production.

These circuits define a code's logical error rate and must be run repeatedly throughout the entire program. The performance of SM circuits is therefore critical to the success of a FTQC system.   While ultimately implemented as physical circuits, SM circuits have challenges that are not addressed by existing circuit optimization tools. Importantly, inside SM circuits themselves errors are expected to occur, and how errors propagate through SM circuits directly impacts which errors are detectable and correctable, defining the code's logical error rate.

While well-established for static magnetic fluxes, the effect's behavior under time-varying fluxes remains an open and debated question. Employing the WKB method, we derive the AB phase shift for a time-dependent magnetic vector potential, demonstrating that for circular paths in the quasistatic regime, it is proportional to the time-averaged enclosed magnetic flux, \\(Δφ_{\\rm AB} = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_0^T e Φ(t) \\, dt\\), with the total phase shift, including kinetic contributions, equaling \\(e Φ(0)\\). For non-circular paths, the phase shift depends on both the flux history and path geometry, revealing the effect's hybrid nature involving gauge potentials and induced electric fields.

The algorithm runs in polynomial time and achieves an exponential speedup over both transverse-field quantum annealing and state-of-the-art classical solvers on these instances, under assumptions supported by analytical and numerical evidence. We identify the essential quantum mechanism enabling the speedup as the use of a non-stoquastic XX-driver to access a larger sign-structured admissible subspace beyond the stoquastic regime, which allows sign-generating quantum interference to create smooth evolution paths that bypass tunneling. This identifies a distinctive quantum mechanism underlying the speedup and explains why no efficient classical analogue is likely to exist.

Transition probabilities under the stochastic dynamics satisfy the Born rule, whereas the constrained classical evolution produces the normal probability distributions characteristic of classical measurements.

To address this issue, we present a theoretical analysis of the aforementioned spatial responses of a standard local-oscillator (LO)- dressed RARE. Our results reveal that increasing the vapor-cell length produces a receive beam aligned with the LO field, with a beamwidth inversely proportional to the cell length. This finding enables atomic beamforming to enhance received signal-to-noise ratio using only a single-antenna RARE.

To overcome the limitation imposed by exponential decay, we propose a novel RARE architecture termed segmental vapor cell. This architecture consists of vapor-cell segments separated by clear-air gaps, allowing the total cell length (and hence propagation loss) to remain fixed while the effective cell length increases.

However, non-unitary operations can also be implemented through block encodings, where additional ancilla qubits are introduced and later measured. While block encoding has a number of well-established theoretical applications, its practical implementation has been prohibitively expensive for current quantum hardware. In this paper, we present practical and explicit block encoding circuits implementing matrix polynomial transformations of a target matrix. With standard approaches, block-encoding a degree-$d$ matrix polynomial requires a circuit depth scaling as $d$ times the depth for block-encoding the original matrix alone. By leveraging the recently introduced Fast One-Qubit Controlled Select LCU (FOQCS-LCU) framework, we show that the additional circuit-depth overhead required for encoding matrix polynomials can be reduced to scale linearly in $d$ with no dependence on system size or the cost of block encoding the original matrix. Moreover, we demonstrate that the FOQCS-LCU circuits and their associated matrix polynomial transformations can be controlled with negligible overhead, enabling efficient applications such as Hadamard tests.

Using this efficiency, we benchmark two limiting measurement paradigms: sequential, in which the same memory is exploited iteratively, and parallel, in which many memories are exploited simultaneously. In both cases, the minimal erasure cost reflects correlations across memories: temporal in sequential, spatial in parallel. Remarkably, when all system-memory correlations are exploited for inference, both paradigms attain the same minimal erasure cost, even in the presence of noise.

In this work, we rule out this possibility by showing that the classical impossibility results largely extend to the quantum world. In particular, when the adversary can issue an unbounded number of challenge messages, we prove an unconditional impossibility, matching the classical barrier. In the case where the adversary may obtain many functional keys, classical arguments only yield impossibility under the assumption of pseudorandom functions; we strengthen this by proving impossibility under the potentially weaker assumption of pseudorandom quantum states. In the same setting, we also establish an alternative impossibility based on public-key encryption.

EP reaches 86.4% accuracy (only 12% below CNN) without backpropagation, while the 4-qubit VQC attains 83.0% accuracy with consistent data efficiency: VQC maintains stable 83% performance with only 50 samples per class, whereas CNN requires 250 samples (5x more data) to reach 98%.

This quantity, which we call the complex Wigner entropy, is defined via the analytic continuation of Shannon's differential entropy of the Wigner function in the complex plane. We show that the complex Wigner entropy enjoys interesting properties, especially its real and imaginary parts are both invariant under Gaussian unitaries (displacements, rotations, and squeezing in phase space). Its real part is physically relevant when considering the evolution of the Wigner function under a Gaussian convolution, while its imaginary part is simply proportional to the negative volume of the Wigner function.

An approximate unitary $k$-design is an ensemble of unitaries with an underlying measure over which the average is close to a Haar random ensemble up to the first $k$ moments.

Such relative-error approximate designs are secure against queries by an adaptive adversary trying to distinguish it from a Haar ensemble. We construct relative-error approximate unitary $k$-design ensembles for which communication between subsystems is $O(1)$ in the system size. These constructions use the alternating projection method to analyze overlapping Haar averages, giving a bound on the convergence speed to the full averaging with respect to the $2$-norm. Using von Neumann subalgebra indices to replace system dimension, the 2-norm distance converts to relative error without introducing any additional dimension dependence.

Among fault-tolerant (FT) gate operations, non-Clifford gates, such as $T$, are particularly expensive due to their reliance on magic state distillation. These costly $T$ gates appear frequently in FT circuits as many quantum algorithms require arbitrary single-qubit rotations, such as $R_x$ and $R_z$ gates, which must be decomposed into a sequence of $T$ and Clifford gates. In many quantum circuits, $R_x$ and $R_z$ gates can be fused to form a single $U3$ unitary. However, existing synthesis methods, such as Gridsynth, rely on indirect decompositions, requiring separate $R_z$ decompositions that result in a threefold increase in $T$ count.   This work presents TensoR-based Arbitrary unitary SYNthesis (trasyn), a novel FT synthesis algorithm that directly synthesizes arbitrary single-qubit unitaries, avoiding the overhead of separate $R_z$ decompositions. By leveraging tensor network-based search, our approach enables native $U3$ synthesis, reducing the $T$ count, Clifford gate count, and approximation error.

Projected ensembles--ensembles of pure states conditioned on measurement outcomes of complementary subsystems--provide higher-order probes of thermalisation, converging at late times to universal maximum-entropy ensembles. In this work, we introduce the partial projected ensemble (PPE) as a framework to study how the spatiotemporal structure of scrambling is imprinted on projected ensembles. The PPE consists of an ensemble of mixed states induced on a subsystem by measurements on a spatially separated part of its complement, tracing out the remainder, naturally capturing scenarios involving discarded outcomes or noise-induced losses. We show that statistical fluctuations of the PPE faithfully track the causal lightcone of information spreading, revealing how scrambling dynamics are encoded in ensemble structure. In addition, we demonstrate that the probabilities of bit-string probabilities (PoPs) associated with the PPE exhibit distinct dynamical regimes and provide an experimentally accessible probe of scrambling. Both PPE fluctuations and PoPs display exponential sensitivity to the size of the discarded region, reflecting exponential degradation of quantum correlations under erasure.

Accordingly, we introduce a class of disordered quantum codes, which we call \"cored product codes\". These codes are derived from classical factors via the hypergraph product but undergo a coring procedure which allows them to be embedded in a lower number of spatial dimensions while preserving code properties. As a specific example, we focus on a fractal code based on the aperiodic pinwheel tiling as the classical factor and perform finite temperature numerical simulations on the resulting three-dimensional quantum memory.

Prior work has primarily relied on the \"logical gap\" metric with the minimum-weight perfect matching decoder, but this approach faces fundamental limitations including computational overhead that scales exponentially with the number of logical qubits and poor generalizability to arbitrary codes beyond surface codes. We develop post-selection strategies based on computationally efficient heuristic confidence metrics that leverage error cluster statistics (specifically, aggregated cluster sizes and log-likelihood ratios) from clustering-based decoders, which are applicable to arbitrary quantum low-density parity check (QLDPC) codes. We validate our method through extensive numerical simulations on surface codes, bivariate bicycle codes, and hypergraph product codes, demonstrating orders of magnitude reductions in logical error rates with moderate abort rates. For instance, applying our strategy to the [[144, 12, 12]] bivariate bicycle code achieves approximately three orders of magnitude reduction in the logical error rate with an abort rate of only 1% (19%) at a physical error rate of 0.1% (0.3%).

We denote these fidelities as the reduced Loschmidt echo (RLE) and the final-state fidelity (FSF), respectively. If region $A$ is the full system, the RLE coincides with the standard Loschmidt echo. We focus on quenches from Gaussian states in several instances of the XY spin chain. In the hydrodynamic limit of long times and large sizes of $A$, with their ratio fixed, the reduced fidelities admit a quasiparticle picture interpretation. Interestingly, for some quenches in the hydrodynamic regime the RLE features a complicated structure with an infinite sequence of nested lightcones, corresponding to quasiparticles with arbitrary large group velocities. This leads to a ''staircase'' of cusp-like singularities in the time-derivative of the fidelity. At the sub-hydrodynamic regime for some quenches the RLE exhibits cusp-like singularities, similar to the so-called dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPT).

Dimensional dependence is observed: in $d>5$ dimensions, the measurement uncertainty decreases monotonically with increasing horizon radius, while coherence increases; in $d=5$, both quantities exhibit non-monotonic behavior due to distinctive thermodynamic properties.
