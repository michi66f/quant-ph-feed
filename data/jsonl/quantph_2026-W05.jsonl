In this work, we study logical T-gate magic-state preparation in GKP-encoded photonic qubits using a repeat-until-success injection protocol combined with outer surface-code protection. We develop an architecture-level modeling framework based on a lightweight density-matrix simulator implemented with standard numerical linear algebra. Finite squeezing is mapped to effective logical dephasing, depolarizing noise is included at the logical level, and photon loss is treated as a heralded erasure process. This approach avoids explicit continuous-variable wavefunction simulation, hardware-specific photonic models, and quantum software frameworks, enabling transparent and computationally efficient exploration of architectural trade-offs. We perform systematic parameter sweeps over squeezing values from 8 to 16 dB, baseline loss probabilities between 0.01 and 0.03, and surface-code distances d = 1, 3, 5, and 7. Across this regime, we evaluate repeat-until-success probability, average injection overhead, and logical magic-state fidelity. We find that success probabilities exceed 0.94 across all studied parameters, with an average overhead close to unity. After outer-code protection, logical fidelities reach approximately 0.77 to 0.80 and show weak sensitivity to moderate photon loss but a strong dependence on squeezing. Phase-boundary analysis identifies minimum squeezing requirements needed to simultaneously achieve high success probability and logical fidelity.

To address this, we introduce a general framework for approximating the cumulative effect of gate-dependent noise using a global depolarizing channel. We specify the regime in which this approximation provides a reliable description of the noisy dynamics. Applying our framework to the thermodynamical two-sort algorithmic cooling (TSAC) protocol, we analytically derive its asymptotic cooling limit in the presence of noise.

Inspired by analogous concepts in quantum state discrimination, we introduce the unambiguous randomness of a quantum state and measurement, and, relaxing the assumption of perfect accuracy, randomness with a fixed rate of inconclusive outcomes. We solve these problems for any state and projective measurement in dimension two, as well as for an isotropically noisy state measured in an unbiased basis of any dimension. In the latter case, we find that, given a fixed amount of total noise, an eavesdropper correlated only to the noisy state is always outperformed by an eavesdropper with joint correlations to both a noisy state and a noisy measurement.

We propose a subspace-confined QAOA tailored to CBRS multi-channel allocation, in which each node-wise channel register is initialized in a Generalized Dicke state and evolved under an intra-register XY mixer. This ansatz confines the dynamics to a tensor product of Johnson graphs that exactly encode per-node Hamming-weight constraints.

Existing training approaches largely rely on gradient-based procedural optimization, which often suffers from slow convergence, sensitivity to hyperparameters, and instability near sharp minima. In this work, we propose an alternative inverse-probability algebraic learning framework for QNNs. Instead of updating parameters through incremental gradient descent, our method treats learning as a local inverse problem in probability space, directly mapping discrepancies between predicted and target Born-rule probabilities to parameter corrections via a pseudo-inverse of the Jacobian. This algebraic update is covariant, does not require learning-rate tuning, and enables rapid movement toward the vicinity of a loss minimum in a single step. We systematically compare the proposed method with gradient descent and Adam optimization in both regression and classification tasks using a teacher-student QNN benchmark. Our results show that algebraic learning converges significantly faster, escapes loss plateaus, and achieves lower final errors. Under finite-shot sampling, the method exhibits near-optimal error scaling, while remaining robust against intrinsic hardware noise such as dephasing.

In this work, we give an efficiently implementable discrete-time counterpart to any continuous-time quantum Gibbs sampler. Our construction preserves the desirable features (i)-(iii) while does not decrease the spectral gap. Also, we give an alternative highly coherent quantum generalization of detailed balanced dynamics that resembles another physically derived master equation, and propose a smooth interpolation between this and earlier constructions. Moreover, we show how to make earlier Metropolis-style Gibbs samplers (which estimate energies both before and after jumps) exactly detailed balanced. We study generic properties of all constructions, including the uniqueness of the fixed point, the (quasi-)locality of the resulting operators. Finally, we prove that the spectral gap of our new highly coherent Gibbs sampler is constant at high temperatures, thereby it mixes fast. We hope that our systematic approach to quantum Glauber and Metropolis dynamics will lead to widespread applications in various domains.", "primary_category": "quant-ph", "categories": ["quant-ph", "cs.DS"], "published": "2024-05-30T17:57:04Z", "updated": "2026-01-23T16:20:45Z", "abs_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20322v2", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.20322v2.pdf"}

In chaotic dynamics, projected ensembles exhibit universal statistics governed by maximum-entropy principles, known as deep thermalization. At infinite temperature this universality is characterized by Haar-random ensembles. More generally, physical constraints such as finite temperature or conservation laws lead to Scrooge ensembles, which are maximally entropic distributions of pure states consistent with these constraints. Here we introduce Scrooge $k$-designs, which approximate Scrooge ensembles, and use this framework to sharpen the conditions under which Scrooge-like behavior emerges. We first show that global Scrooge designs arise from long-time chaotic unitary dynamics alone, without measurements. Second, we show that measuring a complementary subsystem of a scrambled global state drawn from a global Scrooge $2k$-design induces a local Scrooge $k$-design. Third, we show that a local Scrooge $k$-design arises from an arbitrary entangled state when the complementary system is measured in a scrambled basis induced by a unitary drawn from a Haar $2k$-design. These results show that the resources required to generate approximate Scrooge ensembles scale only with the desired degree of approximation, enabling efficient implementations.

We consider a cyclic operation mode, where the working medium couples sequentially to hot and cold reservoirs, and a continuous mode with both reservoirs coupled simultaneously. We derive an effective temperature for the finite-size reservoirs determining the entropy production for two-state engines in the sequential coupling scenario, and show that finite-size reservoirs can meaningfully affect the power when compared to infinite-size reservoirs in both sequential and simultaneous coupling scenarios. We also investigate a three-state engine comprising two interacting units and optimize its performance in the presence of a finite reservoir. Notably, we show that the efficiency at maximum power can exceed the Curzon-Ahlborn bound with finite reservoirs.

The scheme synchronizes phase biasing with momentum-kick reversal through the atomic transit time, extracting four interferometric phases to suppress Raman beam path-length errors, while two-photon detuning feedback maintains a pseudo-inertial frame and eliminates cross-coupling. The interferometer enables simultaneous measurements of acceleration and rotation based on an absolute, atom-interferometric reference, with high bandwidth and a wide dynamic range. Numerical simulations verify that acceleration and angular velocity can be measured simultaneously and independently in real time without cross-coupling, demonstrating the absolute, decoupled nature of the proposed measurement scheme.

To demonstrate this potential, we investigate an electrical bias-controlled topological discontinuity in valley polarization within a two-segment armchair nanoribbon of gapless single-layer graphene. This discontinuity is created at the interface by applying opposite in-plane, transverse electrical biases to the two segments. An efficient tight-binding theoretical formulation is developed to calculate electron states in the structure. In a reference configuration, we obtain energy eigenvalues and probability distributions that feature interface-confined electron eigenstates induced by the topological discontinuity. Moreover, to elucidate the implications of interface confinement for electron transport, a modified configuration is introduced to transform the eigenstates into transport-active, quasi-localized ones. We show that such states result in Fano \"anti-resonances\" in transmission spectra. The resilience of these quasi-localized states and their associated Fano fingerprints is examined with respect to fluctuations. Finally, a proof-of-concept band-stop electron energy filter is presented, highlighting the potential of this confinement mechanism and, more broadly, valley-dependent topological physics in designing nanoscale devices in gapless single-layer graphene.", "primary_category": "cond-mat.mes-hall", "categories": ["cond-mat.mes-hall", "quant-ph"], "published": "2025-10-07T08:04:39Z", "updated": "2026-01-23T14:22:23Z", "abs_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05653v3", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05653v3.pdf"}

Kidwell", "Joseph E. Subotnik"], "abstract": "$Λ$-doubling of diatomic molecules is a subtle microscopic phenomenon that has long attracted the attention of experimental groups, insofar as rotation of molecular $\\textit{nuclei}$ induces small energetic changes in the (degenerate) $\\textit{electronic}$ state. A direct description of such a phenomenon clearly requires going beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Here we show that a phase space theory previously developed to capture electronic momentum and model vibrational circular dichroism -- and which we have postulated should also describe the Einstein-de Haas effect, a macroscopic manifestation of angular momentum conservation -- is also able to recover the $Λ$-doubling energy splitting (or $Λ$-splitting) of the NO molecule nearly quantitatively. The key observation is that, by parameterizing the electronic Hamiltonian in terms of both nuclear position ($\\mathbf{X}$) and nuclear momentum ($\\mathbf{P}$), a phase space method yields potential energy surfaces that explicitly include the electron-rotation coupling and correctly conserve angular momentum (which we show is essential to capture $Λ-$doubling). The data presented in this manuscript offers another small glimpse into the rich physics that one can learn from investigating phase space potential energy surfaces $E_{PS}(\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{P})$ as a function of both nuclear position and momentum, all at a computational cost comparable to standard Born-Oppenheimer electronic structure calculations.", "primary_category": "physics.chem-ph", "categories": ["physics.chem-ph", "physics.atom-ph", "quant-ph"], "published": "2025-12-15T15:46:15Z", "updated": "2026-01-23T02:46:49Z", "abs_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13448v2", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13448v2.pdf"}

We find that multiple vibrational modes participate cooperatively in the JT dynamics, giving rise to a shallow adiabatic potential energy surface with low barriers, consistent with thermally activated pseudorotation. The dominant JT-active modes are found to closely correspond to vibrational features observed in two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES), in agreement with recent ab initio molecular dynamics simulations.
