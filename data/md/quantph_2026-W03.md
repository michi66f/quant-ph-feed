Abstract:
Cloud-accessible quantum processors enable direct execution of quantum algorithms on heterogeneous hardware platforms. Unlike classical systems, however, identical quantum circuits may exhibit substantially different behavior across devices due to architectural variations in qubit connectivity, gate fidelity, and coherence times.   In this work, we systematically benchmark five representative quantum algorithms - Bell state preparation, GHZ state generation, Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), Grover's Search, and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) - across trapped-ion, superconducting, and simulator backends using Amazon Braket. Performance metrics including fidelity, CHSH violation, success probability, circuit depth, and gate counts are evaluated.   Our results demonstrate a strong dependence of algorithmic performance on hardware topology and noise characteristics. For example, 10-qubit GHZ states achieved fidelities above 0.8 on trapped-ion hardware, while superconducting platforms dropped below 0.15 due to routing overhead and accumulated two-qubit gate errors. These findings highlight the importance of hardware-aware algorithm selection and provide practical guidance for benchmarking in the NISQ era.

Abstract:
Temporal quantum states generalize the multipartite density operator formalism to the time domain, enabling a unified treatment of quantum systems with both timelike and spacelike correlations. Despite a growing body of temporal state formalisms, their precise operational relationships and conceptual distinctions remain unclear. In this work, we resolve this issue by extending the Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) quasiprobability distribution to arbitrary multi-time quantum processes and, more broadly, to general spatiotemporal settings. We define left, right, and doubled temporal KD quasiprobabilities, together with their real components, which we identify as temporal Margenau-Hill (MH) quasiprobabilities. All of these quantities are experimentally accessible through interferometric measurement schemes. By characterizing their nonclassical features, we show that the generalized KD framework provides a unified operational foundation for a wide class of temporal state approaches and can be directly implemented via temporal or spatiotemporal Bloch tomography.

Abstract:
Quantum batteries, microscopic devices designed to address energy demands in quantum technologies, promise high power during charging and discharging processes. Yet their practical usefulness and performance depend critically on reliability, quantified by the noise-to-signal ratios (NSRs), i.e., normalized fluctuations of work and power, where reliability decreases inversely with increasing NSR. We establish fundamental limits to this reliability: both work and power NSRs are universally bounded from below by a function of charging speed, imposing a reliability limit inherent to any quantum battery. More strikingly, we find that a quantum mechanical uncertainty relation forbids the simultaneous suppression of work and power fluctuations, revealing a fundamental trade-off that also limits the reliability of quantum batteries. We analyze the trade-off and limits, as well as their scaling behavior, across parallel (local), collective {(fully non-local)}, and hybrid (semi-local) charging schemes for many-body quantum batteries, finding that increasing power by exploiting stronger entanglement comes at the cost of diminished reliability of power. Similar trends are also observed in the charging of quantum batteries utilizing transverse Ising-like interactions. These suggest that achieving both high power and reliability require neither parallel nor collective charging, but a hybrid charging scheme with an intermediate range of interactions. Therefore, our analysis shapes the practical and efficient design of reliable and high-performance quantum batteries.

Abstract:
Quantum Darwinism explains how tenets of classical reality, such as objectivity and repeatability, emerge within a quantum universe. As a mathematical framework, Quantum Darwinism also provides guiding principles that determine what physical models support emergent classical behavior, what specific observables obey classical laws, and much more. For instance, in a recent work we elucidated that the limit under which Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability distributions become effectively classical coincides with the regime where the underlying physical model obeys the rules of Quantum Darwinism. In the present work, we study the breaking of Quantum Darwinism in a specific model and how that translates to non-classical measurement statistics. Interestingly, this provides effective tools for benchmarking the genuine quantum characteristics of NISQ hardware, which we demonstrate with IonQ's trapped-ion and IBM's superconducting quantum computing platforms.

Abstract:
Within the Segal-Bargmann representation, a generalized Rabi model is considered that includes both two-photon and asymmetric terms. It is shown that, through a suitable transformation, nearly exact solutions can be obtained using the Bethe ansatz approach. Applying this approach to the meromorphic structure of the resulting differential equation, solutions in exact analytical form of the fourth-order problem are presented for both an arbitrary state and for the restriction between the parameters.

Abstract:
Quantum effect enables enhanced estimation precision in metrology, with the Heisenberg limit (HL) representing the ultimate limit allowed by quantum mechanics. Although the HL is generally unattainable in the presence of noise, quantum error correction (QEC) can recover the HL in various scenarios. A notable example is estimating a Pauli-$Z$ signal under bit-flip noise using the repetition code, which is both optimal for metrology and robust against noise. However, previous protocols often assume noise affects only the signal accumulation step, while the QEC operations -- including state preparation and measurement -- are noiseless. To overcome this limitation, we study fault-tolerant quantum metrology where all qubit operations are subject to noise. We focus on estimating a Pauli-$Z$ signal under bit-flip noise, together with state preparation and measurement errors in all QEC operations. We propose a fault-tolerant metrological protocol where a repetition code is prepared via repeated syndrome measurements, followed by a fault-tolerant logical measurement. We demonstrate the existence of an error threshold, below which errors are effectively suppressed and the HL is attained.

Abstract:
We report a three-dimensional lumped-element multimode microwave resonator that enables homogeneous collective manipulation and dispersive readout of a macroscopic spin ensemble. By exploiting geometric symmetry, two antisymmetric modes with strongly suppressed cross-talk are engineered to spatially overlap and couple to the same ensemble at distinct frequencies. Using negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond at 28 mK, we observe collective strong coupling with a coupling strength of 5.0 MHz and demonstrate non-destructive dispersive readout via a detuned mode. The compact design, tunable coupling, and high field homogeneity make this resonator a versatile device for hybrid spin-photon systems and multimode solid-state quantum technologies.

Abstract:
As remarked by Boltzmann, the Second Law of Thermodynamics is notable for the fact that it is readily proved using elementary statistical arguments, but becomes harder and harder to verify the more precise the microscopic description of a system. In this article, we investigate one particular realization of the 2nd Law, namely Joule heating in a wire under electrical bias. We analyze the production of entropy in an exactly solvable model of a quantum wire wherein the conserved flow of entropy under unitary quantum evolution is taken into account using an exact formula for the entropy current of a system of independent quantum particles. In this exact microscopic description of the quantum dynamics, the entropy production due to Joule heating does not arise automatically. Instead, we show that the expected entropy production is realized in the limit of a large number of local measurements by a series of floating thermoelectric probes along the length of the wire, which inject entropy into the system as a result of the information obtained via their continuous measurements of the system. The decoherence resulting from inelastic processes introduced by the local measurements is essential to the phenomenon of entropy production due to Joule heating, and would be expected to arise due to inelastic scattering in real systems of interacting particles.

Abstract:
We observe time-correlated four photons within a correlation window of 20ns from spontaneous four-wave mixing via a double-Lambda scheme in a cold cloud of Rb-87 atoms. In contrast to high-power pulsed pumping of chi^(2) nonlinear processes in crystals, our scheme generates correlated four-photon states by direct continuous-wave pumping at nominal powers. We verify the presence of genuinely correlated four-photon states over accidentals by higher-order intensity cross-correlation measurements and accidental subtraction. We infer a time-correlated four-photon generation rate of 2.5(4)x10^6 counts per second close to saturation. The photons produced are near-resonant with atomic transitions, and have a bandwidth in the order of MHz, making them readily compatible with quantum networking applications involving atoms.

Abstract:
We present a theoretical model for realizing squeezed lasing in a trapped-ion system without relying on engineered baths or tailored dissipative reservoirs. Our approach leverages the intrinsic ion-phonon interactions, where two trapped ions, each interacting with a shared vibrational mode, are driven on both red- and blue-sideband transitions. This enables the creation of a squeezed state of motion through the dynamic coupling between the ions' internal states and the phonon mode. Unlike traditional methods that require bath engineering, our model demonstrates that squeezed lasing can be achieved through a direct manipulation of ion-phonon interactions, with no external reservoirs required. We explore the steady-state behavior of the system, analyzing the onset of lasing, gain-loss balance, and the role of the squeezing parameter in shaping the phonon field's statistical properties. Furthermore, we show how external coherent drives can stabilize phase coherence and achieve controlled quadrature squeezing, offering a simple yet effective method for achieving squeezed lasing in quantum mechanical systems. Our findings provide new insights into the realization of squeezed states in phonon-based systems, with potential applications in quantum metrology and information processing.

Abstract:
We investigate the simultaneous estimation of two optical phases in a three-mode interferometer assisted by optical parametric amplification (OPA). By employing the normally ordered characteristic-function formalism, we analytically obtain all photon-number moments of the output quantum state, enabling an explicit evaluation of the quantum Fisher information matrix for multiparameter phase estimation. In the lossless scenario, we show that uniformly applied OPA significantly enhances the attainable precision beyond that of an unamplified interferometer. By analyzing the second-order correlation functions, we demonstrate that this enhancement originates from the amplification of intra-mode photon-number correlations, rather than from inter-mode correlations. We further extend our analysis to realistic interferometers with photon loss using a purification-based variational approach. Although loss degrades the achievable precision, the OPA-assisted scheme retains a clear advantage for moderate loss, indicating a degree of robustness against dissipation. Our results clarify the physical mechanism underlying OPA-enhanced multiparameter quantum metrology and provide guidelines for optimizing phase estimation protocols in realistic noisy environments.

Abstract:
We investigate thermalization and the quantum-classical correspondence in the fully-connected Bose-Hubbard model, focusing on the four-site case. Our analysis of the classical phase-space structure and its excited-state quantum phase transitions leads us to three dynamical regimes: symmetry-breaking low-energy states, an intermediate region where quantum and classical equilibrium states markedly disagree, and a high-energy regime with restored correspondence. The observed classical intermittency above the first excited-state quantum phase transition contrasts with quantum dynamics, which remains trapped in symmetry-breaking sectors despite the existence of a classically connected phase space. This mismatch originates from the population of imbalance-carrying eigenstates and persists even for relatively large number of particles. Our results reveal unexpectedly slow convergence to the classical limit, signaling robust finite-size effects in collective many-body dynamics.

Abstract:
High-visibility quantum interference between independent photons is essential for demonstrating multi-photon quantum information processing, and it is closely linked to the spectral purity of correlated photon pairs. In this study, we investigate two approaches to enhance the purity of photon pairs generated from a type-0 PPLN waveguide by systematically varying both the pump bandwidth and the interference-filter bandwidth, and we directly compare their performance under identical experimental conditions. The spectral purity is evaluated from measured joint spectral intensities using Schmidt decomposition. Both methods significantly improve the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference visibility to approximately 80%. However, the former approach also yields a higher three-fold coincidence rate, which is advantageous for our ongoing efforts to increase the state fidelity and generation rate of multi-photon time-bin Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states.

Abstract:
The Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) provides a powerful framework with the potential for quantum speedups across a wide range of applications. Its core input model is the block encoding framework, in which non-unitary matrices are embedded into larger unitary matrices. Because the gate complexity of the block-encoding subroutine largely determines the overall cost of QSVT-based algorithms, developing new and more efficient block encodings is crucial for achieving practical quantum advantage. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for constructing quantum circuits that block encode linear combinations of Pauli strings. Our approach relies on two key components. First, we apply a transformation that converts the Pauli strings into pairwise anti-commuting ones, making the transformed linear combination unitary and thus directly implementable as a quantum circuit. Second, we employ a correction transformation based on the stabilizer formalism which uses an ancilla register to restore the original Pauli strings. Our method can be implemented with an ancilla register whose size scales logarithmically with the number of system qubits. It can also be extended to larger ancilla registers, which can substantially reduce the overall quantum circuit complexity. We present four concrete examples and use numerical simulations to compare our method's circuit complexity with that of the Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) approach. We find that our method achieves circuit complexities comparable to or better than LCU, with possible advantages when the structure of the target operators can be exploited. These results suggest that our approach could enable more efficient block encodings for a range of relevant problems extending beyond the examples analyzed in this work.

Abstract:
We propose a quantum distance measure between probability distributions encoded in quantum states based on the fragility of quantum interference under entangling evolution. The Quantum Interference-Induced Bhattacharyya Distance (QIBD) is defined through a single-ancilla interferometric circuit in which an interaction Hamiltonian generates correlation-dependent phases that modulate interference visibility. When the interaction vanishes, QIBD reduces to the classical Bhattacharyya distance; however, for entangling interactions, it cannot be expressed as a function of fidelity alone. Numerical simulations demonstrate that QIBD responds to correlation structure in ways that overlap-based measures do not, suggesting potential utility in contexts where interaction-aligned correlations are physically relevant.

Abstract:
We investigate the Floquet spectrum of a detuned, driven two-level system and show that it exhibits exact quasienergy crossings when the detuning is an integer multiple of the energy quantum of the driving field. This behavior can be explained by a hidden time-nonlocal parity, which allows the Floquet modes to be classified as even or odd. Then a generic feature is the emergence of exact crossings between quasienergies of different parity. A constructive proof of the existence of the symmetry is based on a scalar recurrence relation. Moreover, we present a general scheme for its numerical computation, which can be applied to models beyond the two-level system. Analytical results are illustrated with numerical data.

Abstract:
We propose an analysis of the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm applied to electronic systems by investigating its free parameters such as the time step, number of phase qubits, initial state preparation, number of measurement shots, and parameters related to the unitary operators implementation. A deep understanding of these parameters is crucial to pave the way towards more automation of QPE applied to predictive computational chemistry and material science. To our knowledge, various aspects remain unexplored and a holistic parameter selection method remains to be developed. After reviewing key QPE features, we propose a constructive method to set the QPE free parameters. We derive, among other things, explicit conditions for achieving chemical accuracy in ground energy estimation. We also demonstrate that, using our conditions, the complexity of the Trotterized version of QPE tends to depend only on physical system properties and not on the number of phase qubits. Numerical simulations on the H2 molecule provide a first validation of our approach.

Abstract:
The rate of $m$-photon transitions in matter, induced by an incident light field, depends on the field's $m$th order coherence function. Consequently, the coherence properties of the light field may be shaped to increase the rate of multi-photon transitions. Here, we determine the optimal state of a weak fixed-intensity, narrow-band incident light field, with a restricted maximal photon number, that optimally drives $m$-photon transitions in the case of a short-lived atomic multilevel system. We show that, in this case, no quantum properties of the light field need to be exploited, but that classical mixtures of coherent states are optimal.

Abstract:
We investigate the spontaneous emission of a two-level system coupled to a photonic waveguide, showing that dynamical dephasing in the photon modes profoundly alters the decay law. In the absence of dephasing, the emitter displays conventional exponential decay followed by a long-time power-law tail -- observable only at extremely low survival probabilities. Strikingly, when dephasing is introduced, a robust power-law decay emerges already at short times, driven by photon diffusion in the dynamically disordered environment rather than spectral edge effects. These results reveal a novel, decoherence-induced mechanism for non-exponential spontaneous emission in waveguide QED platforms.

Abstract:
Sub-Planck structures in non-Gaussian probability densities of phase space variables are pervasive in bosonic quantum systems. They are almost universally present if the bosonic system evolves via nonlinear dynamics or nonlinear measurements. So far, identification and comparison of such structures remains qualitative. Here we provide a universally applicable and experimentally friendly method to identify, quantify and compare sub-Planck structures from directly measurable or estimated probability densities of single phase space variables. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method on experimental high order Fock states of a single-atom mechanical oscillator, showing provably finer sub-Planck structures as the Fock occupation increases despite the accompanying uncertainty increase in the phonon, position, and momentum bases.

Abstract:
We propose and analyze a scheme to generate squeezed light by storing a classical probe pulse in a Bose--Einstein condensate (BEC) and exploiting the nonlinear evolution caused by atom--atom collisions during the storage time. A $Λ$-type optical memory interface maps a chosen temporal probe mode onto a single phase-matched collective spin wave; for a coherent input this prepares a tunable coherent spin state of a two-component BEC, with its initial spin orientation set by the stored mean excitation number and the phase relation between the probe and control fields. Collisional interactions during storage then implement one-axis-twisting dynamics and generate spin squeezing in the atomic ensemble. We account for realistic loss and finite memory and retrieval efficiencies, and model readout as a single-mode beam-splitter mapping that transfers the atomic quadrature squeezing onto a propagating optical mode. We identify optimal storage times and predict that, under realistic conditions, several dB of squeezing can be transferred to the retrieved light.

In this work, we investigate the dynamics of a network of qubits where each edge corresponds to an independent two-qubit interaction. By applying tools from percolation theory, we study how entanglement dynamically spreads across the network. We show that the interplay between unitary evolution and spatially correlated disorder leads to a non-standard percolation phenomenology, significantly richer than uniform bond percolation and featuring hysteresis. A two-colour correlated bond percolation model, whose phase diagram is determined via numerical simulations and a mean-field theory, fully elucidates the physics behind this phenomenon.

Abstract:
We present a universal framework for simulating $N$-dimensional linear Itô stochastic differential equations (SDEs) on quantum computers with additive or multiplicative noises. Building on a unitary dilation technique, we establish a rigorous correspondence between the general linear SDE \[ dX_t = A(t) X_t\,dt + \sum_{j=1}^J B_j(t)X_t\,dW_t^j \] and a Stochastic Schrödinger Equation (SSE) on a dilated Hilbert space. Crucially, this embedding is pathwise exact: the classical solution is recovered as a projection of the dilated quantum state for each fixed noise realization. We demonstrate that the resulting SSE is {naturally implementable} on digital quantum processors, where the stochastic Wiener increments correspond directly to measurement outcomes of ancillary qubits. Exploiting this physical mapping, we develop two algorithmic strategies: (1) a trajectory-based approach that uses sequential weak measurements to realize efficient stochastic integrators, including a second-order scheme, and (2) an ensemble-based approach that maps moment evolution to a deterministic Lindblad quantum master equation, enabling simulation without Monte Carlo sampling. We provide error bounds based on a stochastic light-cone analysis and validate the framework with numerical simulations.

Abstract:
Photonic quantum computers use the bosonic statistics of photons to construct, through quantum interference, the large entangled states required for measurement-based quantum computation. Therefore, any which-way information present in the photons will degrade quantum interference and introduce errors. While quantum error correction can address such errors in principle, it is highly resource-intensive and operates with a low error threshold, requiring numerous high-quality optical components. We experimentally demonstrate scalable, optimal photon distillation as a substantially more resource-efficient strategy to reduce indistinguishability errors in a way that is compatible with fault-tolerant operation. Photon distillation is an intrinsically bosonic, coherent error-mitigation technique which exploits quantum interference to project single photons into purified internal states, thereby reducing indistinguishability errors at both a higher efficiency and higher threshold than quantum error correction. We observe unconditional error reduction (i.e., below-threshold behaviour) consistent with theoretical predictions, even when accounting for noise introduced by the distillation gate, thereby achieving actual net-gain error mitigation under conditions relevant for fault-tolerant quantum computing. We anticipate photon distillation will find uses in large-scale quantum computers. We also expect this work to inspire the search for additional intrinsically bosonic error-reduction strategies, even for fault-tolerant architectures.

Abstract:
Analogue quantum simulators offer a promising route to explore quantum many-body dynamics beyond classical reach in the near term. However, their vulnerability to noise limits the accuracy of simulations. Here, we establish a new framework for mitigating noise in analogue quantum simulation, operating in a time-continuous manner. To our knowledge, this is the first protocol that is fully analogue and that achieves exact noise cancellation. Our method requires a small number of ancillary qubits, whose interaction with the system$-$combined with classical post-processing of joint measurement data$-$is tailored to cancel the effect of noise. Furthermore, the protocol is Hamiltonian-independent, robust to realistic ancilla noise, and avoids any discretization, preserving the continuous-time nature of the system's dynamics. This work opens a new direction for achieving high-fidelity analogue quantum simulation in the presence of noise.

Abstract:
Among variational quantum algorithms designed for NISQ devices, ADAPT-VQE stands out for its robustness against barren plateaus, particularly in estimating molecular ground states. On the other hand, counterdiabatic algorithms have shown advantages in both performance and circuit depth when compared to standard adiabatic approaches. In this work, we propose a hybrid method that integrates the ADAPT-VQE framework with counterdiabatic driving within an adiabatic evolution scheme. Specifically, we map the molecular Hamiltonian to a qubit representation and construct an adiabatic Hamiltonian, from which an approximate adiabatic gauge potential is computed using nested commutators. The resulting operator terms define the operator pool, and the ADAPT-VQE algorithm is applied to iteratively select the most relevant elements for the ansatz. Our results demonstrate improvements in performance and reductions in circuit depth compared to using either counterdiabatic algorithms or ADAPT-VQE with fermionic excitation operators, thus supporting the effectiveness of combining both paradigms in molecular simulations.

Abstract:
We investigate the emergence of cooperative radiation phenomena in ensembles of two-level atoms coupled to a lossy resonant cavity beyond the Markovian and mean-field approximations. By deriving a complete analytical solution for the two-emitter case and employing a numerically exact method for larger ensembles, we characterize the full transition from Markovian to non-Markovian collective dynamics for systems of up to $10^3$ emitters. Our results reveal three distinct regimes: a Markovian phase exhibiting the standard superradiant burst, a non-Markovian phase featuring spontaneous superabsorption of the emitted field, and a critical regime marked by pulsed collective emission. We show that the critical spectral width separating these behaviors increases monotonically with the number of emitters, demonstrating that environmental memory effects can be enhanced by cooperativity. Finally, we find that the superradiant scaling of the peak intensity progressively degrades with increasing system size, approaching a subquadratic law in the limit of a perfect cavity. In this regime, spontaneous superabsorption emerges as a distinct manifestation of non-Markovian cooperativity.

Abstract:
We construct asymptotic quantum many-body scars (AQMBS) in one-dimensional SU($N$) Hubbard chains ($N\geq 3$) by embedding the scar subspace into an auxiliary Hilbert subspace $\mathcal{H}_P$ and identifying a parent Hamiltonian within it, together with a corresponding extension of the restricted spectrum-generating algebra to the multi-ladder case. Unlike previous applications of the parent-Hamiltonian scheme, we show that the parent Hamiltonian becomes the SU($N$) ferromagnetic Heisenberg model rather than the spin-1/2 case, so that its gapless magnons realize explicit AQMBS of the original model. Working in the doublon-holon subspace, we derive this mapping, obtain the one-magnon dispersion for periodic and open boundaries, and prove (i) orthogonality to the tower of scar states, (ii) vanishing energy variance in the thermodynamic limit, and (iii) subvolume entanglement entropy with rigorous MPS/MPO bounds. Our results broaden the parent-Hamiltonian family for AQMBS beyond spin-1/2 and provide analytic, low-entanglement excitations in SU($N$)-symmetric systems.

Abstract:
Coherent interconnects between gate-defined silicon quantum processing units are essential for scalable quantum computation and long-range entanglement. We argue that one-dimensional electron channels formed in the silicon quantum well of a Si/SiGe heterostructure exhibit strong Coulomb interactions and realize strongly interacting Luttinger liquid physics. At low electron densities, the system enters a Wigner regime characterized by dominant 4kF correlations; increasing the electron density leads to a crossover from the Wigner regime to a Friedel regime with dominant 2kF correlations. We support these results through large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations of the interacting ground state under both screened and unscreened Coulomb potentials. We propose experimental signatures of the Wigner-Friedel crossover via charge transport and charge sensing in both zero- and high-magnetic field limits. We also analyze the impact of short-range correlated disorder - including random alloy fluctuations and valley splitting variations - and identify that the Wigner-Friedel crossover remains robust until disorder levels of about 400 micro eV. Finally, we show that the Wigner regime enables long-range capacitive coupling between quantum dots across the interconnect, suggesting a route to create long-range entanglement between solid-state qubits. Our results position silicon interconnects as a platform for studying Luttinger liquid physics and for enabling architectures supporting nonlocal quantum error correction and quantum simulation.

Abstract:
Rydberg excitons in $\mathrm{Cu_2O}$ simultaneously give rise to two very different optical responses under resonant two-photon excitation: a coherent second-harmonic signal mediated by the excitonic second order susceptibility tensor $χ^{(2)}$, and a secondary emission originating from the radiative decay of real exciton populations. Distinguishing these two channels is essential for interpreting nonlinear and quantum-optical experiments based on high-$n$ states, yet their temporal, spectral, and power-dependent signatures often overlap. Here we use time-resolved resonant two-photon excitation to cleanly separate SHG and SE and to map how each depends on $n$, temperature, excitation power, and crystal quality. This approach reveals the markedly different sensitivities of the two processes to phonons, defects, and many-body effects, and establishes practical criteria for identifying SE and SHG in a wide range of experimental conditions. Our results provide a unified framework for interpreting emission from Rydberg excitons and offer guidelines for future studies aiming to exploit their nonlinear response and long-range interactions.

Abstract:
Spontaneous pattern formation out of homogeneous media is one of the well-understood examples of hydrodynamic instabilities in classical systems, which naturally leads to the question of its manifestation in quantum fluids. Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of atomic gases have been an ideal platform for studying many-body quantum phenomena, such as superfluidity, and simultaneously providing an opportunity to broaden our understanding of classical hydrodynamics into quantum systems. In this review, we introduce a range of experimental studies on the pattern formation in quantum fluids of atomic gases under external driving, including Faraday waves in one and two dimensions, surface patterns, and counterflow instabilities in a mixture of superfluids. The pattern formation in the quantum system can be understood through the parametric amplification process, where an unstable dynamical mode can be exponentially amplified, similar to classical systems. Remarkably, the governing equations for surface excitations of trapped BECs can be mathematically equivalent to those of shallow water, indicating a universal description of the hydrodynamic instability across classical and quantum domains. However, the condensates, as superfluids, also possess fundamental quantum characteristics, such as quantized vorticity and a distinct dissipation channel. These unique features showcase many-body fragmentation under strong modulation and the generation of vortices in the nonlinear regime, which could offer a pathway to the study of quantum turbulence. Furthermore, the coexistence of long-range phase coherence and density modulation in driven condensates could provide unexplored features, such as those seen in supersolid-like sound modes, within nonequilibrium settings.

Abstract:
We prove a noncommutative $(p,p)$-Poincaré inequality for trace-symmetric quantum Markov semigroups on tracial von Neumann algebras, assuming only the existence of a spectral gap. Extending semi-commutative results of Huang and Tropp, our argument uses Markov dilations to obtain chain-rule estimates for Dirichlet forms and employs amalgamated free products to define an appropriate noncommutative derivation. We further generalize the argument to non-tracial $σ$-finite von Neumann algebras under the weaker assumption of GNS-detailed balance, using Haagerup's reduction and Kosaki's interpolation theorem. As applications, we recover noncommutative Khintchine and sub-exponential concentration inequalities.

Abstract:
Though the performance of room-temperature masers has improved over the last decade, relatively little attention has been paid to the optics used to pump the maser's gain medium. In this work, we investigate a novel multi-blade optical ``injector'' that permits more effective and more scaleable pumping. The reported work encompasses an interdisciplinary mix of conceptualization, simulation, crystal growth, fabrication, and microwave engineering. Our gain medium is pentacene dissolved as a solid solution with para-terphenyl (Pc:PTP) molecular crystal. We accurately determine this pentacene's molecular absorption cross-section as a function of wavelength. Ray-tracing is then used to assess how different designs of waveguide inject light into the Pc:PTP crystal. A multi-blade injector made of high-refractive-index glass (namely Ohara S-TIH6) is predicted to pump it more completely and uniformly than previous designs. Upon hand-fabricating such an injector and Bridgman-growing a crystal of 0.1% Pc:PTP over it, an experimental maser oscillator using this combined injector-crystal assembly is demonstrated. The performance and scaleability of multiblade injection vis-a-vis alternative strategies is analyzed.

Abstract:
Symmetry-breaking order at low temperatures is often accompanied by slow relaxation dynamics, due to diverging free-energy barriers arising from interfaces between different ordered states. Here, we extend this correspondence to classical topological order, where the ordered states are locally indistinguishable, so there is no notion of interfaces between them. We study the relaxation dynamics of the three-dimensional (3D) classical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory (LGT) as a canonical example. We prove a lower bound on the mixing time in the deconfined phase, $t_{\text{mix}} = \exp [Ω(L)]$, where L is the linear system size. This bound applies even in the presence of perturbations that explicitly break the one-form symmetry between different long-lived states. This perturbation destroys the energy barriers between ordered states, but we show that entropic effects nevertheless lead to diverging free-energy barriers at nonzero temperature. Our proof establishes the LGT as a robust finite-temperature classical memory. We further prove that entropic effects lead to an emergent one-form symmetry, via a notion that we make precise. We argue that the exponential mixing time follows from universal properties of the deconfined phase, and numerically corroborate this expectation by exploring mixing time scales at the Higgs and confinement transitions out of the deconfined phase. These transitions are found to exhibit markedly different dynamic scaling, even though both have the static critical exponents of the 3D Ising model. We expect this novel entropic mechanism for memory and emergent symmetry to also bring insight into self-correcting quantum memories.

The weak value approximation has been in use for thirty-five years, but it has not as of yet received a truly complete derivation, leaving its mathematical validity in a state of limbo. Herein, I fill this gap, deriving the weak value approximation under the von Neumann and qubit probe models. Not only does this provide a level of mathematical support to the weak value approximation not attained in previous works, but the techniques demonstrated in the process might be usable by others to forge similar derivations for alternative models, thus teasing the possibility of even broader validation in the future.

Abstract:
We provide a derivation of quantum theory in which the existence of an energy observable that generates the reversible dynamics follows directly from information-theoretic principles. Our first principle is that every reversible dynamics is implementable through a collision model, i.e. a sequence of fast collisions with an array of identically prepared systems. Combined with four additional principles, known as causality, classical decomposability, purity preservation, and strong symmetry, the collision model pins down the quantum framework, sets up a one-to-one correspondence between energy observables and generators of the dynamics, and provides an information-theoretic derivation of the Mandelstam-Tamm bound on the speed of quantum evolutions.

Abstract:
We show in this paper that a strong and easy connection exists between quantum error correction and Lattice Gauge Theories (LGT) by using the Gauge symmetry to construct an efficient error-correcting code for Abelian LGTs. We identify the logical operations on this gauge covariant code and show that the corresponding Hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of these logical operations while preserving the locality of the interactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these substitutions actually give a new way of writing the LGT as an equivalent hardcore boson model. Finally we demonstrate a method to perform fault-tolerant time evolution of the Hamiltonian within the gauge covariant code using both product formulas and qubitization approaches. This opens up the possibility of inexpensive end to end dynamical simulations that save physical qubits by blurring the lines between simulation algorithms and quantum error correcting codes.

Abstract:
In the flavour of categorical quantum mechanics, we extend nonlocal games to allow quantum questions and answers, using quantum sets (special symmetric dagger Frobenius algebras) and the quantum functions of Musto, Reutter, and Verdon [arXiv:1711.07945]. Equations are presented using a diagrammatic calculus for tensor categories. To this quantum question and answer setting, we extend the standard definitions, including strategies, correlations, and synchronicity, and we use these definitions to extend results about synchronicity. We extend the graph homomorphism (isomorphism) game to quantum graphs, and show it is synchronous (bisynchronous) and connect its perfect (bi)strategies to quantum graph homomorphisms (isomorphisms). Our extended definitions agree with the existing quantum games literature, except in the case of synchronicity.

Abstract:
Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) have achieved initial success in various tasks by integrating quantum computing and neural networks. However, growing concerns about their reliability and robustness highlight the need for systematic testing. Unfortunately, current testing methods for QNNs remain underdeveloped, with limited practical utility and insufficient empirical evaluation. As an initial effort, we design a set of superposition-targeted coverage criteria to evaluate QNN state exploration embedded in test suites. To characterize the effectiveness, scalability, and robustness of the criteria, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study using benchmark datasets and QNN architectures. We first evaluate their sensitivity to input diversity under multiple data settings, and analyze their correlation with the number of injected faults. We then assess their scalability to increasing circuit scales. The robustness is further studied under practical quantum constraints including insufficient measurement and quantum noise. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of quantifying test adequacy and the potential applicability to larger-scale circuits and realistic quantum execution, while also revealing some limitations. Finally, we provide insights and recommendations for future QNN testing.

Abstract:
The occurrence of a second-order quantum phase transition in the Dicke model is a well-established feature. On the contrary, a comprehensive understanding of the corresponding open system, particularly in the proximity of the critical point, remains elusive. When approaching the critical point, the system inevitably enters first the system-bath ultrastrong coupling regime and finally the deepstrong coupling regime, causing the failure of usual approximations adopted to describe open quantum systems. We study the interaction of the Dicke model with bosonic bath fields in the absence of additional approximations, which usually relies on the weakness of the system-bath coupling. We find that the critical point is not affected by the interaction with the environment. Moreover, the interaction with the environment is not able to affect the system ground-state condensates in the superradiant phase, whereas the bath fields are infected by the system and acquire macroscopic occupations. The obtained reflection spectra display lineshapes which become increasingly asymmetric, both in the normal and superradiant phases, when approaching the critical point.

Abstract:
In continuous quantum field theories, the entanglement entropy of a subsystem with sharp corners on its boundary exhibits a universal corner-dependent contribution. We study this contribution through the lens of lattice discretization, and demonstrate that this corner dependence emerges naturally from the geometric structure of infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS) on discrete lattices. Using a rigorous counting argument, we show that the bond dimension of an iPEPS representation exhibits a corner-dependent term that matches the predicted term in gapped continuous systems. Crucially, we find that this correspondence only emerges when averaging over all possible lattice orientations and origin positions, revealing a fundamental requirement for properly discretizing continuous systems. Our results provide a geometric understanding of entanglement corner laws and establish a direct connection between continuum field theory predictions and the structure of discrete tensor network representations. We extend our analysis to gauge-invariant systems, where lattice corners crossed by the bipartition boundary contribute an additional corner-dependent term. These findings offer new insights into the relationship between entanglement in continuous and discrete quantum systems.

Abstract:
Quantum error mitigation (QEM) has emerged as a powerful tool for the extraction of useful quantum information from quantum devices. Here, we introduce the Subspace Noise Tailoring (SNT) algorithm, which efficiently combines the cheap cost of Symmetry Verification (SV) and low bias of Probabilistic Error Cancellation (PEC) QEM techniques. We study the performance of our method by simulating the Trotterized time evolution of the spin-1/2 Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) using a variety of local fermion-to-qubit encodings, which define a computational subspace through a set of stabilizers, the measurement of which can be used to post-select noisy quantum data. We study different combinations of QEM and encodings and uncover a rich state diagram of optimal combinations, depending on the hardware performance, system size and available shot budget. We then demonstrate how SNT extends the reach of current noisy quantum computers in terms of the number of fermionic lattice sites and the number of Trotter steps, and quantify the required hardware performance beyond which a noisy device may outperform classical computational methods.

Abstract:
Variational quantum machine learning algorithms have been proposed as promising tools for time series prediction, with the potential to handle complex sequential data more effectively than classical approaches. However, their practical advantage over established classical methods remains uncertain. In this work, we present a comprehensive benchmark study comparing a range of variational quantum algorithms and classical machine learning models for time series forecasting. We evaluate their predictive performance on three chaotic systems across 27 time series prediction tasks of varying complexity, and ensure a fair comparison through extensive hyperparameter optimization. Our results indicate that, in many cases, quantum models struggle to match the accuracy of simple classical counterparts of comparable complexity. Furthermore, we analyze the predictive performance relative to the model complexity and discuss the practical limitations of variational quantum algorithms for time series forecasting.

Abstract:
Probabilistic error cancellation is a quantum error mitigation technique capable of producing unbiased computation results but requires an accurate error model. Constructing this model involves estimating a set of parameters, which, in the worst case, may scale exponentially with the number of qubits. In this paper, we introduce a method called spacetime noise inversion, revealing that unbiased quantum error mitigation can be achieved with just a single accurately measured error parameter and a sampler of Pauli errors. The error sampler can be efficiently implemented in conjunction with quantum error correction. We provide rigorous analyses of bias and cost, showing that the cost of measuring the parameter and sampling errors is low -- comparable to the cost of the computation itself. Moreover, our method is robust to the fluctuation of error parameters, a limitation of unbiased quantum error mitigation in practice. These findings highlight the potential of integrating quantum error mitigation with error correction as a promising approach to suppress computational errors in the early fault-tolerant era.

Abstract:
We explore the relationship between quantum Fisher information (QFI) and the negative of the second derivative of concurrence with respect to the coupling between two qubits, referred to as the curvature of entanglement (CoE). We analyze in detail the pure-state lossless case for which general results can be inferred and we also consider a simple interaction Hamiltonian in the case of one form of loss applied to the qubits. For a two-qubit quantum probe used to estimate the coupling constant appearing in the interaction Hamiltonian we show, for certain initial conditions, that there are times such that CoE = QFI. These times can be associated with the concurrence, viewed as a function of the coupling parameter, being a maximum. We examine the time evolution of the concurrence of the eigenstates of the symmetric logarithmic derivative and show that, for several families of initially separable and initially entangled states, simple product measurements suffice to saturate the quantum Cramér-Rao bound when CoE = QFI, while otherwise, in general, entangled measurements are required giving an operational significance to the points in time when CoE = QFI.

Abstract:
The measurement processes that are traditionally described within the realm of non-relativistic quantum mechanics are transcribed into the covariant framework of Cartan's space, the four-valued representation space of the restricted conformal group for special relativity. It is assumed at the outset that the non-relativistic quantum measurement mechanisms of state reductions as well as the definition of Born probabilities should remain unaltered when the passage to the covariant framework is worked out. The correlations between observations registered in different spacetime frames, concerning intermediate steps and outcomes of microscopic measurements, are attained through the implementation of the orthochronous proper Poincaré subgroup of an appropriate realization of SU(2,2). It appears that the overall work may afford a fundamental background to the construction of covariant quantum computational gates whilst making it feasible to elaborate upon the predicted and observed formation of entangled states in processes of creation-annihilation pairs. It is also suggested that the usually accepted non-locality feature of the old quantum mechanics should be reconsidered inside an actual relativistic formulation. The important question as to whether quantum computation should bear an invariant character is then raised.

Abstract:
Quantum learning encounters fundamental challenges when estimating non-linear properties, owing to the inherent linearity of quantum mechanics. Although recent advances in single-copy randomized measurement protocols have achieved optimal sample complexity for specific tasks like state purity estimation, generalizing these protocols to estimate broader classes of non-linear properties without sacrificing optimality remains an open problem. In this work, we introduce the observable-driven randomized measurement (ORM) protocol enabling the estimation of ${\rm Tr}(Oρ^2)$ for an arbitrary observable $O$ -- an essential quantity in quantum computing and many-body physics. We establish an upper bound for ORM's sample complexity and show its optimality for observables with a large trace-norm, including Pauli and local observables, closing a gap in the literature. For these observables, ORM admits an efficient implementation with Clifford circuits. Numerical experiments validate that ORM requires substantially fewer state samples to achieve the same precision compared to classical shadows. Additionally, we introduce a braiding randomized measurement protocol for multiple low-rank non-linear observables, reducing circuit complexities in practical applications.

Abstract:
Entanglement detection is a fundamental task in quantum information science, serving as a cornerstone for quantum benchmarking and foundational studies. With an increasing qubit number that can be effectively controlled, there is a pressing need for a scalable and robust detection protocol which requires minimal resources while maintaining high detection capability. By integrating the Positive Partial Transposition criterion with variational quantum interference, we propose an entanglement detection protocol that requires moderate classical and quantum computation resources. We numerically show that this protocol achieves a high detection capability with shallow quantum circuits, surpassing some widely-used entanglement detection methods. The protocol also exhibits strong resilience to circuit noise, ensuring its applicability across different physical platforms. We further demonstrate the protocol experimentally on an eight-photon linear-optical platform, where it successfully detects the entanglement of a three-qubit mixed state that is inaccessible to conventional entanglement witnesses. By combining quantum interference with classical optimization, our protocol provides a scalable and resource-efficient route toward practical entanglement detection.

Abstract:
It is widely accepted that quantum error correction is essential for realizing large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing. Recent experiments have demonstrated error correction codes operating below threshold, primarily using local planar codes such as the surface code and color code. In parallel, theoretical advances in quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes promise significantly lower overheads, albeit at the cost of requiring non-local parity checks. While these results are encouraging, implementing such codes remains challenging for near-term experiments, creating obstacles to holistic benchmarking of hardware architectures capable of supporting long-range couplers. In this work, we present a simple construction recipe for small quantum LDPC codes based on recent developments in the field. Our codes are approximately twice as efficient as comparable surface codes, yet require only weight-four parity checks, which simplifies experimental realization compared to other quantum LDPC codes. We provide concrete proposals for implementations with superconducting qubits in flip-chip architectures and with semiconductor spin qubits using shuttling-based approaches.

Abstract:
Basic quantum effects are often illustrated using single particle interferences in two-path interferometers. A wider range of non-classical phenomena can be illustrated using three-path interferometers, but the increased complexity of quantum statistics in a three-dimensional Hilbert space makes it difficult to identify a representative set of observable properties that could be used to characterize specific phenomena. Here, I propose a characterization of pure states based on a five-stage interferometer recently introduced to demonstrate the relation between different measurement contexts (Optica Quantum 1, 63 (2023)). It is shown that the orthogonality relations between the states representing the different measurement contexts can be used to classify pure states within the three-dimensional Hilbert space according to the non-classical correlations between different contexts expressed by negative Kirkwood-Dirac distributions.

Abstract:
The potential of quantum computers to outperform classical ones in practically useful tasks remains challenging in the near term due to scaling limitations and high error rates of current quantum hardware. While quantum error correction (QEC) offers a clear path towards fault tolerance, overcoming the scalability issues will take time. Early applications will likely rely on QEC combined with quantum error mitigation (QEM). We introduce a QEM scheme against both compilation errors and logical-gate noise that is circuit-, QEC code-, and compiler-agnostic. The scheme builds on quasi-probability methods and uses information about the circuit's gates' compilations to attain an unbiased estimation of noiseless expectation values incurring a constant sample-complexity overhead. Moreover, it features maximal circuit size and code distance both independent of the target precision, in contrast to strategies based on QEC alone. We formulate the mitigation procedure as a linear program, demonstrate its efficacy through numerical simulations, and illustrate it for estimating the Jones polynomials of knots. Our method significantly reduces quantum resource requirements for high-precision estimations, offering a practical route towards fault-tolerant quantum computation with precision-independent overheads for fixed circuit complexity and code distance.

Abstract:
We present a closed-form analytic solution for the propagation of an arbitrary charged scalar state in a non-uniform magnetic field. The dynamics are governed by classical beam optics parameters (Courant-Snyder parameters), the Twiss functions, and phase advance, revealing a direct map between quantum evolution and its classical counterpart. The solution decomposes into three components, exhibiting a complex rotation dependent on the sign of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) projection, alongside an intrinsic distortion from interference governed by a generalized Gouy phase. For a relevant Glaser-type magnetic field and a half-blocked twisted electron, we demonstrate that asymmetry reveals interference-driven dynamics beyond rigid rotation. Our fully relativistic framework provides a practical tool for predicting beam behavior in particle accelerators and electron microscopes.

Abstract:
Quantum error correction protocols require rapid and repeated qubit measurements. While multiplexed readout in superconducting quantum systems improves efficiency, fast probe pulses introduce spectral broadening, leading to signal leakage into neighboring readout resonators. This crosstalk results in qubit dephasing and degraded readout fidelity. Here, we introduce a pulse shaping technique inspired by the derivative removal by adiabatic gate (DRAG) protocol to suppress measurement crosstalk during fast readout. By engineering a spectral notch at neighboring resonator frequencies, the method effectively mitigates spurious signal interference. Our approach integrates seamlessly with existing readout architectures, enabling fast, low-crosstalk multiplexed measurements without additional hardware overhead - a critical advancement for scalable quantum computing.

Abstract:
We establish the conditions under which a conservation law associated with a non-invertible operator may be realized as a symmetry in quantum mechanics. As established by Wigner, all quantum symmetries must be represented by either unitary or antiunitary transformations. Relinquishing an implicit assumption of invertibility, we demonstrate that the fundamental invariance of quantum transition probabilities under the application of symmetries mandates that all non-invertible symmetries may only correspond to {\it projective} unitary or antiunitary transformations, i.e., {\it partial isometries}. This extends the notion of physical states beyond conventional rays in Hilbert space to equivalence classes in an {\it extended, gauged Hilbert space}, thereby broadening the traditional understanding of symmetry transformations in quantum theory. We discuss consequences of this result and explicitly illustrate how, in simple model systems, whether symmetries be invertible or non-invertible may be inextricably related to the particular boundary conditions that are being used.

Abstract:
We present the design and characterization of a cryogenic vacuum chamber incorporating mechanical isolation from vibrations, a high numerical-aperture in-vacuum imaging objective, in-vacuum magnetic shielding, and an antenna for global radio-frequency manipulation of trapped ions. The cold shield near 4 K is mechanically referenced to an underlying optical table via thermally insulating supports and exhibits root-mean-square vibrations less than 7.61(4) nm. Using the in-vacuum objective, we can detect 397 nm photons from a trapped $^{40}\mathrm{Ca}^{+}$ ion with 1.77% efficiency and achieve 99.9963(4)% single-shot state-detection fidelity in 50 $μ$s. To characterize the efficacy of the magnetic shields, we perform Ramsey experiments on the ground state qubit and obtain a coherence time of 24(2) ms, which extends to 0.25(1) s with a single spin-echo pulse. XY4 and XY32 dynamical decoupling sequences driven via the radio-frequency antenna extend the coherence to 0.72(2) s and 0.81(3) s, respectively.

Abstract:
Analyzing the impact of noise is of fundamental importance to understand the advantages provided by quantum systems. While the classical simulability of noisy discrete-variable systems is increasingly well understood, noisy bosonic circuits are more challenging to simulate and analyze. Here, we address this gap by introducing the $\textit{displacement propagation}$ algorithm, a continuous-variable analogue of Pauli propagation for simulating noisy bosonic circuits. By exploring the interplay of noise and quantum resources, we identify several computational phase transitions, revealing regimes where even modest noise levels render bosonic circuits efficiently classically simulable. In particular, our analysis reveals a surprising phenomenon: computational resources usually associated with bosonic quantum advantage, namely non-Gaussianity and symplectic coherence, can make the system easier to classically simulate in presence of noise.

Abstract:
We study measurement-induced entanglement generated by column-by-column sampling of noisy 2D random Clifford circuits of size $N$ and depth $T$. Focusing on the operator entanglement $S_{\rm op}$ of the sampling-induced boundary state, first, we reproduce in the noiseless limit a finite-depth transition from area- to volume-law scaling. With on-site probablistic trace noise at any constant rate $p>0$, the maximal $S_{\rm op}$ attained along the sampling trajectory obeys an area law in the boundary length and scales approximately linearly with $T/p$. By analyzing the spatial distribution of stabilizer generators, we observe exponential localization of stabilizer generators; this both accounts for the scaling of the maximal $S_{\rm op}$ and implies an exponential decay of conditional mutual information across buffered tripartitions, which we also confirm numerically. Together, these results indicate that constant local noise destroys long-range, volume-law measurement-induced entanglement in 2D random Clifford circuits. Finally, based on the observed scaling, we conjecture that a tensor-network-based algorithm can efficiently sample from noisy 2D random Clifford circuits (i) at sub-logarithmic depths $T = o(\log N)$ for any constant noise rate $p = Ω(1)$, and (ii) at constant depths $T = O(1)$ for noise rates $p = Ω(\log^{-1}N)$. Finally, we turn to Haar-random circuits of depth $T = 4$, where we observe numerically the same qualitative behavior as in the Clifford circuit.

Abstract:
Relaxation in open quantum systems is fundamental to quantum science and technologies. Yet, the influence of the initial state on relaxation remains a central, largely unanswered question. Here, by systematically characterizing the relaxation behavior of generic initial states, we uncover a typicality phenomenon in high-dimensional open quantum systems: relaxation becomes nearly initial-state-independent as system size increases under verifiable conditions. Crucially, we prove this typicality for thermalization processes above a size-independent temperature. Our findings extend the typicality to open quantum dynamics, in turn identifying a class of systems where two widely used quantities -- the Liouvillian gap and the maximal relaxation time -- merit re-examination. We formalize this with two new concepts: the 'typical strong Mpemba effect' and the 'typical relaxation time'. Beyond these conceptual advances, our results provide practical implications: a scalable route to accelerating relaxation and a typical mixing-time benchmark that complements conventional worst-case metrics for quantum simulations and state preparation.

Abstract:
Critical phenomena have been extensively investigated both theoretically and experimentally in many fields, such as condensed matter physics, biology, e.g., brain criticality, and cosmology. In particular, the behaviour of response functions right at critical points (CPs) is highly topical. It turns out that in the frame of Boltzmann-Gibbs-von Neumann-Shannon approach, the extensive character of entropy breaks down at CPs. The latter implies diverging susceptibilities, which is at odds with experimental observations. Here, we investigate the influence of the spin magnitude $S$ on the quantum Grüneisen parameter $Γ^{0\text{K}}_{q}$ right at CPs for the 1D Ising model under a transverse magnetic field. Our findings are fourfold: $\textit{i}$) for higher $S$, $Γ^{0\text{K}}_{q}$ is increased, but remains finite, reflecting the enhancement of the Hilbert space dimensionality; $\textit{ii}$) the Schmidt decomposition theorem recovers the extensivity of the nonadditive $q$-entropy $S_q$ only for a $\textit{special}$ value of the entropic index $q$; $\textit{iii}$) the universality class in the frame of $S_q$ depends only on the symmetry of the system; $\textit{iv}$) we propose an experimental setup to explore finite-size effects in connection with the Hilbert space occupation at CPs. Our findings unveil both universal and non-universal aspects of quantum criticality in terms of $Γ^{0\text{K}}_{q}$ and $S_q$.

Rydberg atom-based RF sensors offer distinct advantages over conventional dipole antennas for electric field detection.

We derive the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), compare it with classical radar, and estimate Doppler frequency using an invariant function-based method. Simulations show that the quantum radar achieves higher SNR and lower RMSE in velocity estimation than conventional radar.

Abstract:
Non-Markovian memory effects in open quantum systems provide valuable resources for preserving coherence and enhancing controllability. However, exploiting them requires strategies adapted to history-dependent dynamics. We introduce a reinforcement-learning framework that autonomously learns to amplify information backflow in a driven two-level system coupled to a structured reservoir. Using a reward based on the positive time derivative of the trace distance associated with the Breuer-Laine-Piilo measure, we train PPO and SAC agents and benchmark their performance against gradient-based optimal control theory (OCT). While OCT enhances a single dominant backflow peak, RL policies broaden this revival and activate additional contributions in later memory windows, producing sustained positive trace-distance growth over a longer duration. Consequently, the integrated non-Markovianity achieved by RL substantially exceeds that obtained with OCT. These results demonstrate how long-horizon, model-free learning naturally uncovers distributed-backflow strategies and highlight the potential of reinforcement learning for engineering memory effects in open quantum systems.

Abstract:
In this work we present an intuitive construction of the quantum logical axiomatic system provided by George Mackey. The goal of this work is a detailed discussion of the results from the paper 'Physical justification for using the tensor product to describe two quantum systems as one joint system' [1] published by Diederik Aerts and Ingrid Daubechies. This means that we want to show how certain composed physical systems from classical and quantum mechanics should be described logically. To reach this goal, we will, like in [1], discuss a special class of axiomatically defined composed physical systems. With the help of certain results from lattice and c-morphism theory (see [2] and [23]), we will present a detailed proof of the statement, that in the quantum mechanical case, a composed physical system must be described via a tensor product space.

Abstract:
Many body localization (MBL) represents a unique physical phenomenon, providing a testing ground for exploring thermalization, or more precisely its failure. Here we characterize the MBL regime geometrically by the many-body quantum metric (MBQM), defined in the parameter space of twist boundary, and the localization parameter as defined in the modern theory of polarization and insulators. First, we demonstrate that the quantum metric can be used to characterize disordered insulating states by applying this theoretical framework to excited states of the 1D Anderson insulator. There we observe that the MBQM and localization parameter are related in finite realizations despite the states being gapless in the thermodynamic limit. Then, we consider a disordered 1D Bose-Hubbard model and find that we can characterize the ergodic-MBL crossover by comparing the MBQM and localization parameter. We find that we can extract a natural localization length in the MBL regime that characterizes the real space spread of the wave function and can be measured by extracting the quantum metric. Our analysis provides complementary insight into the MBL regime focusing on its insulating properties and providing a localization length whose definition is consistent across a range of insulating phases.

Abstract:
Estimating the global Lipschitz constant of neural networks is crucial for understanding and improving their robustness and generalization capabilities. However, precise calculations are NP-hard, and current semidefinite programming (SDP) methods face challenges such as high memory usage and slow processing speeds. In this paper, we propose HiQ-Lip, a hybrid quantum-classical hierarchical method that leverages quantum computing to estimate the global Lipschitz constant. We tackle the estimation by converting it into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problem and implement a multilevel graph coarsening and refinement strategy to adapt to the constraints of contemporary quantum hardware. Our experimental evaluations on fully connected neural networks demonstrate that HiQ-Lip not only provides estimates comparable to state-of-the-art methods but also significantly accelerates the computation process. In specific tests involving two-layer neural networks with 256 hidden neurons, HiQ-Lip doubles the solving speed and offers more accurate upper bounds than the existing best method, LiPopt. These findings highlight the promising utility of small-scale quantum devices in advancing the estimation of neural network robustness.

Abstract:
We report the results of a search for dark photon dark matter using a cavity that employs a transmon qubit as a frequency tuner. The tuning mechanism utilizes the energy level shift arising from the mode mixing between the qubit and the cavity mode. This method is advantageous as it avoids the frictional heating and electromagnetic leakage associated with mechanical tuning. We searched for a dark matter signal in the mass range $36.132 - 36.179$ $μ$eV and found no significant evidence. As a result, we set the exclusion limit on the kinetic mixing parameter down to approximately $5 \times 10^{-13}$, surpassing the existing limit set by cosmology.

Abstract:
We present an exact diagonalization study of the spectral properties of bosons harmonically confined in a quasi-2D plane and interacting via repulsive Gaussian potential. We consider the lowest $100$ energy levels for systems of $N=12, 16$ and $20$ bosons in two distinct regimes: (a) when the interaction energy is small compared to the trap energy (moderate interaction) and (b) when the interaction energy is comparable to the trap energy (strong interaction), for the non-rotating ($L_{z}=0$) as well as the rotating single-vortex state ($L_{z}=N$). For higher angular momenta, $L_{z}=2N$ and $L_{z}=3N$, only the strong interaction regime is considered. While the nearest-neighbor spacing distribution (NNSD) $P(s)$ and the ratios of consecutive level spacings distribution $P(r)$ are used to study the short-range correlations, the Dyson-Mehta $Δ_3$ statistic and the level number variance $Σ^2(L)$ are used to examine the long-range correlations. In the moderate interaction regime, the non-rotating system exhibits Poisson distribution, a characteristic of the regular energy spectra. In the strong interaction regime, the non-rotating system exhibits chaotic behavior signified by GOE distribution. Furthermore, in the rotating case for the single-vortex state ($L_{z} = N$) in the moderate interaction regime, the system exhibits signatures of weak chaos with some degree of regularity in the energy-level spectra. However, in the strong interaction regime for the rotating case with $L_{z} = N$, $2N$ and $3N$, the system exhibits strong chaotic behavior. The rotation is found to contribute to enhancement of chaotic behavior in the system for both the moderate and the strong interaction regimes. Our results of NNSD analysis are supported by the analysis of the ratios of consecutive level spacings distribution $P(r)$, which does not involve unfolding.

Abstract:
For the centennial of quantum mechanics, we offer an overview of the central role played by quantum information and thermalization in problems involving fundamental properties of spacetime and gravitational physics. This is an open area of research still a century after the initial development of formal quantum mechanics, highlighting the effectiveness of quantum physics in the description of all natural phenomena. These remarkable connections can be highlighted with the tools of modern quantum optics, which effectively addresses the three-fold interplay of interacting atoms, fields, and spacetime backgrounds describing gravitational fields and noninertial systems. In this review article, we select aspects of these phenomena centered on quantum features of the acceleration radiation of particles in the presence of black holes. The ensuing horizon-brightened radiation (HBAR) provides a case study of the role played by quantum physics in nontrivial spacetime behavior, and also shows a fundamental correspondence with black hole thermodynamics.

Abstract:
Higher-form symmetry in a tensor product Hilbert space is always emergent: the symmetry generators become genuinely topological only when the Gauss law is energetically enforced at low energies. In this paper, we present a general method for defining the 't Hooft anomaly of higher-form symmetries in lattice models built on a tensor product Hilbert space. In (2+1)D, for given Gauss law operators realized by finite-depth circuits that generate a finite 1-form $G$ symmetry, we construct an index representing a cohomology class in $H^4(B^2G, U(1))$, which characterizes the corresponding 't Hooft anomaly. This construction generalizes the Else-Nayak characterization of 0-form symmetry anomalies. More broadly, under the assumption of a specified formulation of the $p$-form $G$ symmetry action and Hilbert space structure in arbitrary $d$ spatial dimensions, we show how to characterize the 't Hooft anomaly of the symmetry action by an index valued in $H^{d+2}(B^{p+1}G, U(1))$.

Abstract:
Reconfigurable arrays of neutral atoms are a leading platform for quantum computing, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology. The most common method for atom reconfiguration using optical tweezers relies on frequency chirping of acousto-optic deflectors (AODs). However, chirp-induced acoustic lensing limits the speed of atom transport by deformation of the tweezer profile and warping of the tweezer trajectory. We use a three-dimensional acousto-optic deflector lens (3D-AODL) to mitigate both effects, a design predicted to halve current state-of-the-art long-range transport times. Additionally, we introduce fading-Shepard waveforms that bypass the finite AOD bandwidth and thus enable sustained axial displacement. We demonstrate unrestricted 3D motion within a cuboid volume of at least 200 $μ$m $\times$ 200 $μ$m $\times$ 136 $μ$m, with tweezer velocities exceeding 4.2 m/s. The ability to move optical tweezers along arbitrary trajectories in 3D should enable rapid in-plane and out-of-plane rearrangement of atoms in 2D or 3D tweezer arrays and optical lattices, as well as omnidirectional trajectories and dynamical engineering of optical potentials. This technology has the potential to advance quantum control and atom manipulation in current atom-array quantum computers, boosting clock rates and enabling rapid sorting in geometries scalable to millions of qubits.

Abstract:
The design of supply chain networks in densely populated urban logistics systems faces a timely dilemma: the traditional optimisation approaches are effective to maximise the level of demand perfusion, but they are limited to embracing large expenses in overlapping the facilities and cannibalisation in the market. When tested on a high-fidelity digital twin of the Delhi NCR road network of thirty candidate sites, we establish that Classical Greedy algorithms using the theoretical maximum demand of (473 units) lack any theoretical overlap penalty, but incur a prohibitive overlap penalty (5.08). Here, in comparison, the Quantum-Inspired solution only losses 3.2% of demand (450 compared to 465 units relative to the optimal solution), but the solution preserves 21.8% less operational overlap risk (3.26 compared to 4.17), which can be viewed as a 35.8% improvement compared to the Greedy solution. Geospatial analysis shows that it can be attributed to a shift in strategies: This, in contrast to Classical approaches, which focus on locating facilities in the high-density central areas (North/Central Delhi), the quantum-inspired solver autonomously chooses the diversified topology of the North-south network, penetrating into the underserved periphery growth markets. This is a spatially balanced arrangement which is congruent to the polycentric structure of modern time megacities, and displays better stability to volatility in demand. We have shown that quantum-inspired optimisation methods can close the so-called Linear-Quadratic Gap phenomenon, i.e. the systematic inability of greedy methods to capture the actual quadratic interactions between facilities, and offer a way of computing the pathway to operationally robust and risk-optimised supply chain networks in dense urban conditions.

Abstract:
We analyze the mixing time of open quantum systems governed by the Lindblad master equation, showing it is not only determined by the Liouvillian gap, but also the trace norm of the lowest excited state of Liouvillian superoperator. By utilizing these universal predictors of mixing time, we establish general conditions for the fast and rapid mixing respectively. Specifically, we derive rapid mixing conditions for both the strong and weak dissipation regimes, formulated as sparsity constraints on the Hamiltonian and the local Lindblad operators. Our findings provide a general framework for calculating mixing time and offer a guide for designing dissipation to achieve desired mixing speeds, which has significant implications for efficient experimental state preparation.

Abstract:
Generalizations of Bell's framework to causal networks have yielded new foundational insights and applications, including the use of interventions to enhance the detection of nonclassicality in scenarios with communication. Such interventions, however, become uninformative when all observable variables are space-like separated. To address this limitation, we introduce the latent splitting procedure, a generalization of interventions to quantum networks in which controlled manipulations are applied to latent quantum systems. We show that latent splitting enables the detection of nonclassicality by combining observational and interventional data even when conventional interventions fail. Focusing on the triangle network, we derive new analytical witnesses that robustly certify nonclassicality, including nonlinear inequalities for minimal binary-variable scenarios and extensions of the nonclassical region of previously proposed experiments.

Abstract:
Noise and decoherence are ubiquitous in the dynamics of quantum systems coupled to an external environment. In the regime where environmental correlations decay rapidly, the evolution of a subsytem is well described by a Lindblad quantum master equation. In this work, we introduce a quantum algorithm for simulating unital Lindbladian dynamics by sampling unitary quantum channels without extra ancillas. Using ancillary qubits we show that this algorithm allows approximating general Lindbladians as well. For interacting dephasing Lindbladians coupling two subsystems, we develop a decoupling scheme that reduces the circuit complexity of the simulation. This is achieved by sampling from a time-correlated probability distribution - determined by the evolution of one subsystem, which specifies the stochastic circuit implemented on the complementary subsystem. We demonstrate our approach by studying a model of bosons coupled to fermions via dephasing, which naturally arises from anharmonic effects in an electron-phonon system coupled to a bath. Our method enables tracing out the bosonic degrees of freedom, reducing part of the dynamics to sampling an instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) circuit. The sampled bitstrings then define a corresponding fermionic problem, which in the non-interacting case can be solved efficiently classically. We comment on the computational complexity of this class of dissipative problems, using the known fact that sampling from IQP circuits is believed to be difficult classically.

Abstract:
In recent years, control methods based on different optimization techniques have shed light on the possibilities of processing information in many quantum systems. When exploring the transmission of quantum states, faster transmission times are mandatory to avoid the deleterious effects of multiple sources of decoherence that spoil the transmission process. In particular, using Reinforcement Learning to devise sequences of step-wise external controls provides good transfer policies at short transmission times. We present two approaches to control the transmission of quantum states in qubit chains using external controls to force the dynamical evolution of the chain state. The first approach relies on the well-known Genetic Algorithm to generate a sequence of external controls, while the second approach uses a variant of Reinforcement Learning. The Genetic algorithm achieves excellent transmission fidelity at as short transmission times as Reinforcement Learning, surpassing the fidelities achieved by the latter method. Nevertheless, the Reinforcement Learning method offers robust control policies when the control pulses are noisy enough, owing to an imperfect timing of the pulses, deficient control devices, or other sources of phase decoherence. We present the regime where each method is best suited to control the transmission of arbitrary qubit states.

Abstract:
This paper diagnoses a much-discussed problem in quantum thermodynamics, that of generalizing classical work into the quantum domain. I begin with the no-go theorem of Perarnau-Llobet et al (2017): no universal measurement scheme for quantum work satisfies two intuitive, classically consilient desiderata. I assess this incompatibility as stemming from the measurement problem. Decoherence restores compatibility for all practical purposes, but raises questions about what 'universality' should mean and whether any measurement scheme can be 'universal'. I consider a different standard of universality -- in terms of ontology -- by defining a trajectory-based notion of quantum work using the quantum potential. While this preserves the classical role of work as the integral of forces over distances, and evades the tension of the no-go theorem, consilience fails elsewhere; no single quantum work concept seems capable of preserving all classical features, raising questions for what it takes for successful generalization of the work concept to quantum thermodynamics.

Abstract:
Measurement-Based Quantum Computing (MBQC) is inherently well-suited for Distributed Quantum Computing (DQC): once a resource state is prepared and distributed across a network of quantum nodes, computation proceeds through local measurements coordinated by classical communication. However, since non-local gates acting on different Quantum Processing Units (QPUs) are a bottleneck, it is crucial to optimize the qubit assignment to minimize inter-node entanglement of the shared resource. For graph state resources shared across two QPUs, this task reduces to finding bipartitions with minimal cut rank. We introduce a simulated annealing-based algorithm that efficiently updates the cut rank when two vertices swap sides across a bipartition, such that computing the new cut rank from scratch, which would be much more expensive, is not necessary. We show that the approach is highly effective for determining qubit assignments in distributed MBQC by testing it on grid graphs and the measurement-based Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA).

Abstract:
We provide novel linear combination of unitaries decompositions for a class of discrete elliptic differential operators. Specifically, Poisson problems augmented with periodic, Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin, and mixed boundary conditions are considered on the unit interval and on higher-dimensional rectangular domains. The number of unitary terms required for our decomposition is independent of the number of grid points used in the discretization and scales linearly with the spatial dimension. Explicit circuit constructions for each unitary are given and their complexities analyzed. The worst case depth and elementary gate cost of any such circuit is shown to scale at most logarithmically with respect to number of grid points in the underlying discrete system. We also investigate the cost of using our method within the Variational Quantum Linear Solver algorithm and show favorable scaling. Finally, we extend the proposed decomposition technique to treat problems that include first-order derivative terms with variable coefficients.

Abstract:
We introduce CL-QAS, a continual quantum architecture search framework that mitigates the challenges of costly amplitude encoding and catastrophic forgetting in variational quantum circuits. The method uses Tensor-Train encoding to efficiently compress high-dimensional stochastic signals into low-rank quantum feature representations. A bi-loop learning strategy separates circuit parameter optimization from architecture exploration, while an Elastic Weight Consolidation regularization ensures stability across sequential tasks. We derive theoretical upper bounds on approximation, generalization, and robustness under quantum noise, demonstrating that CL-QAS achieves controllable expressivity, sample-efficient generalization, and smooth convergence without barren plateaus. Empirical evaluations on electrocardiogram (ECG)-based signal classification and financial time-series forecasting confirm substantial improvements in accuracy, balanced accuracy, F1 score, and reward. CL-QAS maintains strong forward and backward transfer and exhibits bounded degradation under depolarizing and readout noise, highlighting its potential for adaptive, noise-resilient quantum learning on near-term devices.

Abstract:
In quantum information processing, implementing arbitrary preparations and measurements on qubits necessitates precise information to identify a specific reference frame (RF). In space quantum communication and sensing, where a shared RF is absent, the interplay between locality and symmetry imposes fundamental restrictions on physical systems. A restriction on realizable unitary operations results in a no-go theorem prohibiting the extraction of locally encoded information in RF-independent distributed metrology. Here, we propose a reversed-encoding method applied to two copies of local-unitary-invariant network states. This approach circumvents the no-go theorem while simultaneously mitigating decoherence-like noise caused by RF misalignment, thereby enabling the complete recovery of the quantum Fisher information (QFI). Furthermore, we confirm local Bell-state measurements as an optimal strategy to saturate the QFI. Our findings pave the way for the field application of distributed quantum sensing, which is inherently subject to unknown RF misalignment and was previously precluded by the no-go theorem.

Abstract:
We introduce a canonical decomposition of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for centered multimode Gaussian states into two additive pieces: an even part that captures changes in the symplectic spectrum and an odd part associated with correlation-generating dynamics. On the pure-state manifold, the even contribution vanishes identically, while the odd contribution coincides with the QFI derived from the natural metric on the Siegel upper half-space, revealing a direct geometric underpinning of pure-Gaussian metrology. This also provides a link between the graphical representation of pure Gaussian states and an explicit expression for the QFI in terms of graphical parameters. For evolutions completely generated by passive Gaussian unitaries (orthogonal symplectics), the odd QFI vanishes, while thermometric parameters contribute purely to the even sector with a simple spectral form; we also derive a state-dependent lower bound on the even QFI in terms of the purity-change rate. We extend the construction to the full QFI matrix, obtaining an additive even odd sector decomposition that clarifies when cross-parameter information vanishes. Applications to unitary sensing (beam splitter versus two-mode squeezing) and to Gaussian channels (loss and phase-insensitive amplification), including joint phase loss estimation, demonstrate how the decomposition cleanly separates resources associated with spectrum versus correlations. The framework supplies practical design rules for continuous-variable sensors and provides a geometric lens for benchmarking probes and channels in Gaussian quantum metrology.

Abstract:
Local realism has been the subject of much discussion in modern physics, partly because our deepest theories of physics appear to contradict one another in regard to whether reality is local. According to general relativity, it is, as physical quantities (perceptible or not) in two spacelike separated regions cannot affect one another. Yet, in quantum theory, it has traditionally been thought that local realism cannot hold and that such effects do occur. This apparent discrepancy between the two theories is resolved by Everettian quantum theory, as first proven by Deutsch & Hayden (2000). In this paper, I will explain how local realism is respected in quantum theory and review the advances in our understanding of locality since Deutsch & Hayden's work, including the concept of local branching and the more general analysis by Raymond-Robichaud (2021)

Abstract:
Power amplifiers (PA) are essential for microwavecontrolled trapped-ion and semiconductor spin based quantum computers (QC). They adjust the power level of the control signal and therefore the processing time of the QC. Their nonlinearities and memory effects degrade the signal quality and, thus, the fidelity of qubit gate operations. Driving the PA with a significant input power back-off reduces nonlinear effects but is neither power-efficient nor cost-effective. To overcome this limitation, this letter augments the conventional signal generation system applied in QCs by digital predistortion (DPD) to linearize the radio frequency (RF) channel. Numerical analysis of the qubit behavior based on measured representative control signals indicates that DPD improves its fidelity.

Abstract:
We propose a current-carrying-chip scheme for generating spatial quantum superpositions using a levitating nanodiamond with a built-in nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre defect. Our setup is quite versatile and we aim to create the superposition for a mass range of $10^{-19}~{\rm kg}< m< 10^{-15}~{\rm kg}$ and a superposition size ${\cal O}(10) {\rm μm} < Δx < {\cal O}(1){\rm nm}$, respectively, in $t\leq 0.1$s, depending on the position we launch from the center of the diamagnetic trap. We provide an in-depth analysis of two parallel chips that can create levitation and spatial superposition along the $x$-axis, while producing a very tight trap in the $y$ direction, and the direction of gravity, i.e., the $z$ direction. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our setup can create a one-dimensional spatial superposition state along the x-axis. Throughout this process, the particle is stably levitated in the z-direction, and its motion is effectively confined in the y-direction for a Gaussian initial condition. This setup presents a viable platform for a diamagnetically levitated nanoparticle for a table-top experiment exploring the possibility of creating a macroscopic Schrödinger Cat state to test the quantum gravity induced entanglement of masses (QGEM) protocol.

Abstract:
Quantum computation (QC) and digital quantum simulation (DQS) essentially require two- or multi-qubit controlled-NOT or -phase gates. We propose an alternative pathway for QC and DQS using a three-qubit parity gate in a Rydberg atom array. The basic principle of the Rydberg atom parity gate (RPG) is that the operation on the target qubit is controlled by the parity of the control qubits. First, we discuss how to construct an RPG based on a dark state resonance. We optimize the gate parameters by numerically analyzing the time evolution of the computational basis states to maximize the gate fidelity. We also show that our proposed RPG is extremely robust against the Rydberg blockade error. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed RPG over the conventional CNOT or CZ gate in QC and DQS, we implement the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm and simulate the Ising Hamiltonian. The results show that RPG can be a better substitute of the CNOT gate to yield better results, as it decreases the circuit noise by reducing circuit depth.

Abstract:
A fundamental problem of fault-tolerant quantum computation with quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes is the tradeoff between connectivity and universality. It is widely believed that in order to perform native logical non-Clifford gates, one needs to resort to 3D product-code constructions. In this work, we extend Kitaev's framework of non-Abelian topological codes on manifolds to non-Abelian qLDPC codes (realized as Clifford-stabilizer codes) and the corresponding combinatorial topological quantum field theories (TQFT) defined on Poincaré CW complexes and certain types of general chain complexes. We also construct the spacetime path integrals as topological invariants on these complexes. Remarkably, we show that native non-Clifford logical gates can be realized using constant-rate 2D hypergraph-product codes and their Clifford-stabilizer variants. This is achieved by a spacetime path integral effectively implementing the addressable gauging measurement of a new type of 0-form subcomplex symmetries, which correspond to addressable transversal Clifford gates and become higher-form symmetries when lifted to higher-dimensional CW complexes or manifolds. Building on this structure, we apply the gauging protocol to the magic state fountain scheme for parallel preparation of $O(\sqrt{n})$ disjoint CZ magic states with code distance of $O(\sqrt{n})$, using a total number of $n$ qubits.

Abstract:
Frequency-bin encoding offers tremendous potential in quantum photonic information processing, in which a single waveguide can support hundreds of lightpaths in a naturally phase-stable fashion. This stability, however, comes at a cost: arbitrary unitary operations can be realized by cascaded electro-optic phase modulators and pulse shapers, but require nontrivial numerical optimization for design and have thus far been limited to discrete tabletop components. In this article, we propose, formalize, and computationally evaluate a new paradigm for universal frequency-bin quantum information processing using acousto-optic scattering processes between distinct transverse modes. We show that controllable phase matching in intermodal processes enables 2$\times$2 frequency beamsplitters and transverse-mode-dependent phase shifters, which together comprise cascadable FRequency-transverse-mODe Operations (FRODOs) that can synthesize any unitary via analytical decomposition procedures. Modeling the performance of both random gates and discrete Fourier transforms, we demonstrate the feasibility of high-fidelity quantum operations with existing integrated photonics technology, highlighting prospects of parallelizable operations achieving 100\% bandwidth utilization. Our approach is realizable with CMOS technology, opening the door to scalable on-chip quantum information processing in the frequency domain.

Abstract:
Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) is a quantum communication technology that offers an unconditional security guarantee. However, the practical deployment of CV-QKD systems remains vulnerable to various quantum attacks. In this paper, we propose a quantum machine learning (QML)-based attack detection framework (QML-ADF) that safeguards the security of high-rate CV-QKD systems. In particular, two alternative QML models -- quantum support vector machines (QSVM) and quantum neural networks (QNN) -- are developed to perform noise-resistant and feature-aware attack detection before conventional data postprocessing. Leveraging feature-rich quantum data from Gaussian modulation and homodyne detection, the QML-ADF effectively detects quantum attacks, including both known and unknown types defined by these distinctive features. The results indicate that all twelve distinct QML variants for both QSVM and QNN exhibit remarkable performance in detecting both known and previously undiscovered quantum attacks, with the best-performing QSVM variant outperforming the top QNN counterpart. Furthermore, we systematically evaluate the performance of the QML-ADF under various physically interpretable noise backends, demonstrating its strong robustness and superior detection performance. We anticipate that the QML-ADF will not only enable robust detection of quantum attacks under realistic deployment conditions but also strengthen the practical security of quantum communication systems.

Abstract:
The motion of atoms in programmable optical tweezer arrays offers many new opportunities for neutral atom quantum science. These include inter- and intra-site atom motion for resource-efficient implementations of fermionic and bosonic modes, respectively, as well as tweezer transport for efficient compilation of arbitrary circuits. However, the exploitation of atomic motion for all three purposes and others is limited by the inertia of the atoms. We present a comprehensive architectural blueprint for the use of fermionic metastable helium-3 ($^3$He$^*$) atoms -- the lightest trappable atomic species -- in programmable optical tweezer arrays. This includes a concrete analysis of atomic structure considerations as well as Rydberg-mediated interactions. We show that inter-tweezer hopping of $^3$He$^*$ atoms can be $\gtrsim3\times$ faster than previous demonstrations with lithium-6. We also demonstrate a new toolbox for encoding and manipulating qubits directly in the tweezer trap potential, uniquely enabled by the light mass of $^3$He$^*$. Finally, we provide several examples of new opportunities for fermionic quantum simulation and computation that leverage the transport and inter-tweezer hopping of $^3$He$^*$ atom arrays. These tools present new methods to improve the resource efficiency of neutral atom quantum science that may also enable quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories and quantum chemistry outside the Born-Oppenheimer approximation

Abstract:
Coherent one-way quantum key distribution (COW-QKD) has been widely investigated, and even been deployed in real-world quantum network. However, the proposal of the zero-error attack has critically undermined its security guarantees, and existing experimental implementations have not yet established security against coherent attacks. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an information-theoretically secure COW-QKD protocol that can resist source side-channel attacks, with secure transmission distances up to 100 km. Our system achieves a secure key rate on the order of kilobits per second over 50 km in the finite-size regime, sufficient for real-time secure voice communication across metropolitan networks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the encrypted transmission of a logo with information-theoretic security over 100 km of optical fiber. These results confirm that COW-QKD can simultaneously provide simplicity and security, establishing it as a strong candidate for deployment in small-scale quantum networks.

Abstract:
We investigate the entanglement structure of bipartite two-qutrit pure states from both geometric and operational perspectives.Using the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix, we analyze how symmetric polynomials characterize pairwise and genuinely three-level correlations. We show that the determinant of the coefficient matrix defines a natural, rank-sensitive geometric invariant that vanishes for all rank-2 states and is nonzero only for rank-3 entangled states. An explicit analytic constraint relating this determinant-based invariant to the I-concurrence is derived, thereby defining the physically accessible region of two-qutrit states in invariant space. Furthermore, we establish an operational correspondence with three-path optical interferometry and analyze conditional visibility and predictability in a qutrit quantum erasure protocol, including the effects of unequal path transmittances. Numerical demonstrations confirm the analytic results and the associated complementarity relations. These findings provide a unified geometric and operational framework for understanding two-qutrit entanglement.

Abstract:
Germanium quantum dot hole spin qubits are compatible with fully electrical control and are progressing toward multi-qubit operations. However, their coherence is limited by charge noise and driving field induced frequency shifts, and the resulting ensemble $1/f$ dephasing. Here we theoretically demonstrate that a bichromatic driving scheme cancels the second order frequency shift from the control field without sacrificing the electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR) rate, and without additional gate design or microwave engineering. Based on this property, we further demonstrate that bichromatic control creates a wide operating window that reduces sensitivity to quasi-static charge noise and thus enhances single qubit gate fidelity. This method provides a low-power route to a stabler frequency operation in germanium hole spin qubits and is readily transferable to other semiconductor spin qubit platforms.

Abstract:
Conventional nuclear magnetic resonance searches for the galactic axion wind lose sensitivity at low frequencies due to the unfavourable scaling of inductive readout. Here, we propose a hybrid architecture where the hyperfine interaction transduces axion-driven nuclear precession into a high-bandwidth electron-spin readout channel. We demonstrate analytically that this dispersive upconversion preserves the specific sidereal and annual modulation signatures required to distinguish dark matter signals from instrumental backgrounds. When instantiated in a silicon ${ }^{209} \text{Bi}$ donor platform, the hybrid sensor is projected to outperform direct nuclear detection by more than an order of magnitude over the $10^{-16}-10^{-6} \text{eV}$ wide mass range. With collective enhancement, the design reaches a $5 σ$ sensitivity to DFSZ axion-nucleon couplings within one year, establishing hyperfine-mediated sensing as a competitive path for compact, solid-state dark matter searches.

Abstract:
Noisy and Intermediate-Scale Quantum, or NISQ, processors are sensitive to noise, prone to quantum decoherence, and are not yet capable of continuous quantum error correction for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Hence, quantum algorithms designed in the pre-fault-tolerant era cannot neglect the noisy nature of the hardware, and investigating the relationship between quantum hardware performance and the output of quantum algorithms is essential. In this work, we experimentally study how hardware-aware variational quantum circuits on a superconducting quantum processing unit can model distributions relevant to specific use-case applications for Credit Risk Analysis, e.g., standard Gaussian distributions for latent factor loading in the Gaussian Conditional Independence model. We use a transpilation technique tailored to the specific quantum hardware topology, which minimizes gate depth and connectivity violations, and we calibrate the gate rotations of the circuit to achieve an optimized output from quantum algorithms. Our results demonstrate the viability of quantum adaptation on a small-scale, proof-of-concept model inspired by financial applications and offer a good starting point for understanding the practical use of NISQ devices.

Abstract:
Quantum secret sharing (QSS) is the multipartite cryptographic primitive. Most of existing QSS protocols are limited by the linear rate-distance bound, and cannot realize the long-distance and high-capacity multipartite key distribution. This paper proposes a polarization (Pol) and phase (Ph) dual degrees of freedom (dual-DOF) QSS protocol based on the weak coherent pulse (WCP) sources. Our protocol combines the single-photon interference, two-photon interference and non-interference principles, and can resist the internal attack from the dishonest player. We develop simulation method to estimate its performance under the beam splitting attack. The simulation results show that our protocol can surpass the linear bound. Comparing with the differential-phase-shift twin-field QSS and WCP-Ph-QSS protocols, our protocol has stronger resistance against the beam splitting attack, and thus has longer maximal communication distance and higher key rate. By using the WCPs with high average photon number ($μ$ = 1.5), our protocol achieves a key rate about 5.4 times of that in WCP-Ph-QSS protocol. Its maximal communication distance (441.7 km) is about 7.9% longer than that of the WCP-Ph-QSS. Our protocol is highly feasible with current experimental technology and offers a promising approach for long-distance and high-capacity quantum networks.

Abstract:
Accurately describing strongly correlated electronic systems remains a central challenge in quantum chemistry, as electron-electron interactions give rise to complex many-body wavefunctions that are difficult to capture with conventional approximations. Classical wavefunction-based approaches, such as the Semistochastic Heat-bath Configuration Interaction (SHCI) and the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG), currently define the state of the art, systematically converging toward the Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) limit, but at a rapidly increasing computational cost. Quantum computing algorithms promise to alleviate this scaling bottleneck by leveraging entanglement and superposition to represent correlated states more compactly. We introduced the Handover-Iterative Variational Quantum Eigensolver (HI-VQE) as a practical quantum computing algorithm with an iterative "handover" mechanism that dynamically exchanges information between quantum and classical computers, even using Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. In this work, we extend the HI-VQE to benchmark two prototypical strongly correlated systems, the nitrogen molecule $N_2$ and iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster, which serve as stringent tests for both classical and quantum electronic-structure methods. By comparing HI-VQE results against Heat-bath Configuration Interaction (HCI) benchmarks, we assess its accuracy, scalability, and ability to capture multireference correlation effects. Achieving quantitative agreement on these canonical systems demonstrates a viable pathway toward quantum-enhanced simulations of complex bioinorganic molecules, catalytic mechanisms, and correlated materials.

Abstract:
After a quantum quench, the integrable system is expected to relax to a non-thermal equilibrium state (NTES) whose local properties are believed to be governed by a generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE). Combining quench action and the form factor approach, we compute the field-field correlation in the NTES produced by an interaction quench of the Lieb-Liniger model. The spectral distribution is shown to be qualitatively different from that of a thermal equilibrium state (TES): a new dispersion branch appears whose microscopic mechanism can be traced to the algebraic decaying tail for the root density distribution function, and indicates the existence of a broader family of NTES featuring similar spectral property.

Abstract:
The techniques of shortcuts to adiabaticity have been proposed to accelerate the "slow" adiabatic processes in various quantum systems with the applications in quantum information processing. In this paper, we study the counter-diabatic driving for fast adiabatic spin manipulation in a two-electron double quantum dot by designing time-dependent electric fields in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. To simplify implementation and find an alternative shortcut, we further transform the Hamiltonian in term of Lie algebra, which allows one to use a single Cartesian component of electric fields. In addition, the relation between energy and time is quantified to show the lower bound for the operation time when the maximum amplitude of electric fields is given. Finally, the fidelity is discussed with respect to noise and systematic errors, which demonstrates that the decoherence effect induced by stochastic environment can be avoided in speeded-up adiabatic control.

Achieving full control of a Bose-Einstein condensate can have valuable applications in metrology, quantum information processing, and quantum condensed matter physics. We propose protocols to simultaneously control the internal (related to its pseudospin-1/2) and motional (position-related) states of a spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a Morse potential. In the presence of synthetic spin-orbit coupling, the state transition of a noninteracting condensate can be implemented by Raman coupling and detuning terms designed by invariant-based inverse engineering. The state transfer may also be driven by tuning the direction of the spin-orbit-coupling field and modulating the magnitude of the effective synthetic magnetic field. The results can be generalized for interacting condensates by changing the time-dependent detuning to compensate for the interaction. We find that a two-level algorithm for the inverse engineering remains numerically accurate even if the entire set of possible states is considered. The proposed approach is robust against the laser-field noise and systematic device-dependent errors.

Abstract:
Graphene-assisted resonant transmission and enhanced Goos-Hänchen shift are investigated in a two-prism frustrated-total-internal-reflection configuration. Due to the excitation of surface plasmons induced by graphene in low terahertz frequency range, there exist the resonant transmission and anomalous Goos-Hänchen shifts in such optical tunneling configuration. As compared to the case of quantum well, graphene sheet with unique optical properties can enhance the resonant transmission with relatively low loss, and modulate the large negative and positive Goos-Hänchen shifts by adjusting chemical potential or electron relaxation time. These intriguing phenomena may lead to some potential applications in graphene-based electro-optic devices.

Abstract:
Entropy production quantifies the amount of irreversibility of a physical process, leading to fundamental bounds for thermodynamic quantities. Particularly in the quantum realm, considerable research has been carried out in the last decades extending entropy production to nonequilibrium processes. We experimentally investigate the entropy production of forward-backward cycles containing different decorrelating processes realized to erase different types of correlations between two interacting systems, from obliterating solely quantum coherence to completely decorrelating local states. We apply these processes to the entanglement of a two-level atom, realized with a circular Rydberg atom, and a light field of a high-quality microwave cavity. The entropy production is computed from the full quantum-state tomography of the system performed at different stages of the interaction-decorrelation sequence. Due to the quantum nature of the atom-cavity system, we find that, although standard, the maximum likelihood estimation method for the density matrix leads to spurious divergences of the entropy production. We propose and implement an alternative estimator that remedies such divergences. Our work experimentally assesses irreversibility of non-thermal processes and addresses the care that must be taken in handling experimental data to estimate the entropy production.

Abstract:
Estimating the ground-state energy of a quantum system is one of the most promising applications for quantum algorithms. Here we propose a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) \emph{Ansatz} for finding ground state configuration interaction (CI) wavefunctions. We map CI for fermions to a quantum circuit using a subspace superposition, then apply diagonal Walsh operators to encode the wavefunction. The algorithm can be used to solve both full CI and selected CI wavefunctions, resuling in exact and near-exact solutions for electronic ground states. Both the subspace selection and wavefunction \emph{Ansatz} can be applied to any Hamiltonian that can be written in a qubit basis. The algorithm bypasses costly classical matrix diagonalizations, which is advantageous for large-scale applications. We demonstrate results for several molecules using quantum simulators and hardware.

Abstract:
We present a comprehensive study of the transient dynamics of multimode Schrödinger cat states in dissipatively coupled resonator arrays using the positive-P phase-space method. By employing the positive-P representation, we derive the exact stochastic differential equations governing the system's dynamics, enabling the simulation of system sizes significantly larger than those accessible via direct master equation simulation. We demonstrate the utility of this method by simulating transient dynamics for networks up to N=21 sites. Furthermore, we critically examine the method's usefulness and limitations, specifically highlighting the computational instability encountered when estimating the state parity in the systems. Our results provide a pathway for scalable simulations of non-Gaussian states in large open quantum systems.

Abstract:
Multielectron tunneling ionization creates ionic coherence crucial for lasing and driving electron motion in molecules. While tunneling is well understood as a single active electron process, less emphasis has been placed on theoretical descriptions of bound electrons during tunneling. This work systematically investigates multielectron tunneling ionization based on the strong field approximation, establishing a theoretical foundation and demonstrating the equivalence of wave function and density matrix approaches for subcycle ionic dynamics. An accurate subcycle nonadiabatic ionization rate is also derived and incorporated into the theory to improve its quantitative accuracy. Applying the theory to N$_{2}$ and CO$_{2}$, this work showcases how an intense laser field can induce ionic coherence in molecules as observed in previous experiments. These findings encourage future investigations into multielectron tunneling ionization and its applications in lasing and in controlling chemical reactions.

Abstract:
As quantum computing machines move towards the utility regime, it is essential that users are able to verify their delegated quantum computations with security guarantees that are (i) robust to noise, (ii) composable with other secure protocols, and (iii) exponentially stronger as the number of resources dedicated to security increases. Previous works that achieve these guarantees and provide modularity necessary to optimization of protocols to real-world hardware are most often expressed in the Measurement-Based Quantum Computation (MBQC) model. This leaves architectures based on the circuit model -- in particular those using the Magic State Injection (MSI) -- with fewer options to verify their computations or with the need to compile their circuits in MBQC leading to overheads.   This paper introduces a family of noise robust, composable and efficient verification protocols for Clifford + MSI circuits that are secure against arbitrary malicious behavior. This family contains the verification protocol of Broadbent (ToC, 2018), extends its security guarantees while also bridging the modularity gap between MBQC and circuit-based protocols, and reducing quantum communication costs. As a result, it opens the prospect of rapid implementation for near-term quantum devices.   Our technique is based on a refined notion of blindness, called magic-blindness, which hides only the injected magic states -- the sole source of non-Clifford computational power. This enables verification by randomly interleaving computation rounds with classically simulable, magic-free test rounds, leading to a trap-based framework for verification. As a result, circuit-based quantum verification attains the same level of security and robustness previously known only in MBQC. It also optimizes the quantum communication cost as transmitted qubits are required only at the locations of state injection.

Abstract:
Negative states are an intrinsic property of relativistic quantum theory and related to anti-particles in the context of the Dirac sea concept. We show that negative states can dominantly contribute to the diffraction amplitude in the quantum dynamics of the two-photon Kapitza-Dirac effect. We draw our conclusion by investigating solutions from time-dependent perturbation theory, where the perturbative solutions are in match with numeric solutions of the relativistic quantum system and also with the numeric and analytic solutions from the relativistic equations of motion of a classical point-like electron in an external standing wave light field. While our numeric solutions assume a strong laser field, the analytic solutions indicate that negative state coupling remains dominant for arbitrary low field amplitudes, where in the single-photon case (Compton scattering) negative state coupling can be mathematically associated with the interaction of a virtual electron-positron pair in the context of a quantized theory in old-fashioned perturbation theory.

Abstract:
Quantum thermometry aims to measure temperature in nanoscale quantum systems, paralleling classical thermometry. However, temperature is not a quantum observable, and most theoretical studies have therefore concentrated on analyzing fundamental precision limits set by the quantum Fisher information through the quantum Cramer-Rao bound. In contrast, whether a direct temperature readout can be achieved in quantum thermometry remains largely unexplored, particularly under the nonequilibrium conditions prevalent in real-world applications. To address this, we develop a direct temperature readout scheme based on a thermodynamic inference strategy. The scheme integrates two conceptual developments: (i) By applying the maximum entropy principle with the thermometer's mean energy as a constraint, we assign a reference temperature to the nonequilibrium thermometer. We demonstrate that this reference temperature outperforms a commonly used effective temperature defined through equilibrium analogy. (ii) We obtain positive semi-definite error functions that lower-bound the deviation of the reference temperature from the true temperature-in analogy to the quantum Cramer-Rao bound for the mean squared error-and vanish upon thermalization with the sample. Combining the reference temperature with these error functions, we introduce a notion of corrected dynamical temperature which furnishes a postprocessed temperature readout under nonequilibrium conditions. We validate the corrected dynamical temperature in a qubit-based thermometer under a range of nonequilibrium initial states, confirming its capability to estimate the true temperature. Importantly, we find that increasing quantum coherence can enhance the precision of this readout.

Abstract:
Dictionary learning (DL) is a core tool in signal processing and machine learning for discovering sparse representations of data. In contrast with classical successes, there is currently no practical quantum dictionary learning algorithm. We argue that this absence stems from structural mismatches between classical DL formulations and the operational constraints of quantum computing. We identify the fundamental bottlenecks that prevent efficient quantum realization of classical DL and show how a structurally restricted model, doubly sparse dictionary learning (DSDL), naturally avoids these problems. We present a simple, hybrid quantum-classical algorithm based on projection-based randomized Kaczmarz iterations with Qiskit-compatible quantum inner products. We outline practical considerations and share an open-source implementation at https://github.com/AngshulMajumdar/quantum-dsdl-kaczmarz. The goal is not to claim exponential speedups, but to realign dictionary learning with the realities of near-term quantum devices.

Abstract:
At the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning, quantum machine learning (QML) is poised to revolutionize artificial intelligence. However, the vulnerability of the current generation of quantum computers to noise and computational error poses a significant barrier to this vision. Whilst quantum error correction (QEC) offers a promising solution for almost any type of hardware noise, its application requires millions of qubits to encode even a simple logical algorithm, rendering it impractical in the near term. In this chapter, we examine strategies for integrating QEC and quantum error detection (QED) into QML under realistic resource constraints. We first quantify the resource demands of fully error-corrected QML and propose a partial QEC approach that reduces overhead while enabling error correction. We then demonstrate the application of a simple QED method, evaluating its impact on QML performance and highlighting challenges we have yet to overcome before we achieve fully fault-tolerant QML.

Abstract:
In our paper [1], our numerical simulations showed that, unlike displacement and conventional squeezing, higher-order squeezing exhibits oscillatory dynamics. Subsequently, Gordillo and Puebla pointed out that simulation results depend on whether the state space in the simulations is even or odd [2]. Using additional derivations, they argued that the oscillatory dynamics is unphysical and that the photon number must increase monotonically as a function of the squeezing parameter $r$. We agree with the observation of an even-odd parity dependence in the simulations. We independently noticed the same feature in our simulations after the publication of Ref. [1]. This observation led us to perform a more detailed investigation of the numerical simulation and mathematical aspects of the generalized squeezing problem. Our new findings were reported in Ref. [3]. Further analysis was reported in Ref. [4]. Our conclusion is that the generalized squeezing operator is physically not well defined but can be made well defined when combined with additional information about the physical system under study. We demonstrated this point in the case where we include an additional nonlinear interaction term in the Hamiltonian. We disagree with the claim that the photon number must be a monotonically increasing function of $r$. This claim contradicts the mathematically rigorous results of Ref. [4]. Furthermore, we show that the oscillatory behaviour persists in two closely related, well-behaved models.

Abstract:
Fault-tolerant modular quantum computing requires stabilizer measurements across the modules in a quantum network. For this, entangled states of high quality and rate must be distributed. Currently, two main types of entanglement distribution protocols exist, namely emission-based and scattering-based, each with its own advantages and drawbacks. On the one hand, scattering-based protocols with cavities or waveguides are fast but demand stringent hardware such as high-efficiency integrated circulators or strong waveguide coupling. On the other hand, emission-based platforms are experimentally feasible but so far rely on Bell-pair fusion with extensive use of slow two-qubit memory gates, limiting thresholds to $\approx 0.16\%$. Here, we consider a fully distributed surface code using emission-based entanglement schemes that generate GHZ states in a single shot, i.e., without the need for Bell-pair fusions. We show that our optical setup produces Bell pairs, W states, and GHZ states, enabling both memory-based and optical protocols for distilling high-fidelity GHZ states with significantly improved success rates. Furthermore, we introduce protocols that completely eliminate the need for memory-based two-qubit gates, achieving thresholds of $\approx 0.19\%$ with modest hardware enhancements, increasing to above $\approx 0.24\%$ with photon-number-resolving detectors. These results show the feasibility of emission-based architectures for scalable fault-tolerant operation.

Abstract:
We study the on-resonance Spin-1/2 Double Kicked Rotor, a periodically driven quantum system that hosts topological phases. Motivated by experimental constraints, we analyze the effects of open and periodic boundary conditions in contrast to the idealized case of infinite momentum space. As a bulk probe for topological invariants, we focus on the Mean Chiral Displacement (MCD) and show that it exhibits a pronounced sensitivity to boundary conditions, which can be traced to the dynamics in momentum space. Under open boundaries, states that would otherwise extend freely become localized at the edges of the finite momentum space, forming quasienergy edge states. While the bulk response measured by the MCD is strongly affected once the evolving wave packet reaches the boundaries, the persistence of these edge states still reflects the bulk-edge correspondence and provides reliable signatures of topological transitions.

Abstract:
Quantum networks form the backbone of long-distance quantum information processing. Genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) serves as a key indicator of network performance and overall state quality. However, the widely used methods for certifying GME suffer from a major drawback that they either detect only a limited range of states or are applicable only to systems with a small number of parties. To overcome these limitations, we propose a family of sub-symmetric witnesses (SSWs), which are tractable both theoretically and experimentally. Analytically, we establish a connection between SSWs and the cut space of graph theory, enabling several powerful detection criteria tailored to practical quantum networks. Numerically, we show that the optimal detection can be formulated as a linear program, offering a significant efficiency advantage over the semidefinite programs commonly employed in quantum certification. Experimentally, SSWs can be evaluated via local measurements, with resource requirements independent of the local dimension in general, and even independent of the overall network size in many practical networks.

Abstract:
We consider a stationary quantum system consisting of two non-interacting yet entangled subsystems, $Ξ$ and $Γ$. We identify a quantum theory characterizing $Ξ$ such that, in the quantum-to-classical crossover of the composite system, $Γ$ behaves as a test particle within the gravitational field of a Schwarzschild Black Hole (SBH) near its event horizon. We then show that this same quantum theory naturally provides a representation of $Ξ$ in terms of bosonic modes, whose features match those of the Hawking radiation; this facilitates the establishment of precise relations between the phenomenological parameters of the SBH and the microscopic details of the quantum model for $Ξ$. Finally, we recognize that the conditions used to characterize $Γ$ and $Ξ$ coincide with those required by the Page and Wootters mechanism for identifying an evolving system and an associated clock. This leads us to discuss how the quantum model for $Ξ$ endows the SBH with all the characteristics of a "perfect" clock.

Abstract:
Tim Maudlin has argued that the standard formulation of quantum mechanics fails to provide a clear ontology and dynamics and that the de Broglie--Bohm pilot-wave theory offers a better completion of the formalism, more in line with Einstein's concerns. I suggest that while Bohmian mechanics improves on textbook quantum theory, it does not go far enough. In particular, it relies on the ``quantum equilibrium hypothesis'' and accepts explicit nonlocality as fundamental. A deeper completion is available in stochastic mechanics, where the wavefunction and the Born rule emerge from an underlying diffusion process, and in a contextual, category-theoretic semantics in which measurement and EPR--Bell correlations are reinterpreted as features of contextual truth rather than of mysterious dynamics. In this framework, the measurement problem and ``spooky action-at-a-distance'' are dissolved rather than solved. Finally, a dynamics based on Rosen's ``classical Schrödinger equation'' provides a continuous passage between quantum and classical regimes, eliminating any sharp Heisenberg cut.

Abstract:
Branch selection, including postselection, is a standard method for implementing nonunitary transformations in quantum algorithms. Conventionally, states associated with unsuccessful branches are discarded and treated as useless. Here we propose a generic framework that reuses these failure branches as thermodynamic resources. The central element is an athermal bath that is naturally generated during the reset of a failure branch. By coupling this bath to a target system prior to relaxation, useful thermodynamic tasks can be performed, enabling performance beyond conventional thermodynamic limits. As an application, we analyze information erasure and derive the resulting gain analytically. We further demonstrate the framework by implementing the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm on IBM's superconducting quantum processor. Despite substantial noise and errors in current hardware, our method achieves erasure with heat dissipation below the Landauer limit. These results establish a practical connection between quantum computing and quantum thermodynamics and suggest a route toward reducing thermodynamic costs in future large-scale quantum computers.

Abstract:
The dual-type qubit scheme is an emerging method to suppress crosstalk errors in scalable trapped-ion quantum computation and quantum network. Here we report a hardware-economic way to control dual-type $^{171}\mathrm{Yb}^+$ qubits using a single $355\,$nm mode-locked pulsed laser. Utilizing its broad frequency comb structure, we drive the Raman transitions of both qubit types encoded in the $S_{1/2}$ and the $F_{7/2}$ hyperfine levels, and probe their carrier transitions and the motional sidebands. We further demonstrate a direct entangling gate between the two qubit types. Our work can simplify the manipulation of the $^{171}\mathrm{Yb}^+$ qubits both at the hardware and the software level.

Abstract:
We formulate a quantum mechanical system consisting of a single discrete state coupled to an infinite ladder of equally-spaced states, the coupling between the two being given by a Lorentzian profile. Various limits of this system correspond to well-known models from quantum optics, namely, the narrow resonance limit gives the Rabi system, the wide resonance limit gives the Bixon-Jortner system, the wide resonance, true continuum limit gives the Wigner-Weisskopf system, and the fixed resonance, true continuum limit gives a system that is typically studied by methods developed by Fano. We give a semi-analytical solution of the eigenvalue problem by reducing it to a transcendental equation, and demonstrate the aforementioned limiting behaviors. We then study the dynamics of the initial discrete state numerically, and show that it gives a wide range of behaviors in various limiting cases as predicted by our asymptotic theory including exponential decay, revivals, Rabi oscillations, and damped oscillations. The ability of this system to interpolate between such a rich set of behaviors and existing model systems, and the accessibility of a semi-analytical solution, make it a useful model system in quantum optics and related fields.

This paper proposes a quantum algorithm for Markov chain spectral gap estimation that is quasi-optimal (i.e., optimal up to a polylogarithmic factor) in the number of vertices for all parameters, and additionally quasi-optimal in the reciprocal of the spectral gap itself, if the permitted relative error is above some critical value. In particular, these results constitute an almost quadratic advantage over the best-possible classical algorithm. Our algorithm also improves on the quantum state of the art, and we contend that this is not just theoretically interesting but also potentially practically impactful in real-world applications: knowing a Markov chain's spectral gap can speed-up sampling in Markov chain Monte Carlo.   Our approach uses the quantum singular value transformation, and as a result we also develop some theory around block-encoding Markov chain transition matrices, which is potentially of independent interest. In particular, we introduce explicit block-encoding methods for the transition matrices of two algebraically-defined classes of Markov chains.

Abstract:
The Lifshitz formula and methods of its preparation in the literature are considered. It is shown that in Lifshitz's work itself, this formula is given without a consistent conclusion. Moreover, the approach to the conclusion proposed in this work does not allow us to obtain it. The most general conclusion of this formula can be the method proposed by Levin and Rytov, the variation method of Schwinger and the method proposed by Van Kampen and co-authors. The Levin and Rytov approach is applicable in principle to bodies of arbitrary shape if the diffraction loss fields for electric and magnetic dipoles are determined, while the Van Kampen approach is applicable to any plane-layered structure and is quite simple. It is enough to write down the dispersion equations of the plasmon-polaritone structure. The specific dispersion force for a number of structures is calculated based on the Van Kampen method. It is shown that at small gaps, the force (pressure) density changes the inverse fourth-degree dependence on the distance and practically ceases to depend on it at distances less than 1 nm. For thin identical plates, this density is proportional to the square of their thickness at such distances, but the dependence quickly becomes saturated and already at thicknesses of the order of 10 nm practically ceases to depend on it.

Abstract:
High-dimensional entanglement is considered to hold great potential for quantum key distribution (QKD) in high-loss and -noise scenarios. To harness its robustness, we construct a source for high-dimensional time-bin entangled photons optimized for high brightness, low complexity, and long-term stability. We certify the generated high-dimensional entanglement with a new witness employing nested Franson interferometry. Finally, we obtain key rates using a novel, noise-resilient QKD protocol. Our flexible evaluation method, centered around discretizations of the time stream, enables the same dataset to be processed while varying parameters such as state dimensionality and time bin length, allowing optimization of performance under given environmental conditions. Our results indicate regions within the accessible parameter space where high key rates per time are achievable for dimensionalities larger than two.

Abstract:
In this work, we present analytical solutions of Schrödinger equation for Coulomb potential in presence of a Dunkl reflection operator. Expressions are offered for eigenvalues, eigenfunctions and radial densities for H-isoelectronic series (Z=1-3). The degeneracy in energy in absence and presence of the reflection has been discussed. The standard deviation, Shannon entropy, Rényi entropy in position space have been derived for arbitrary quantum states. Then several important complexity measures like López-Ruiz-Mancini-Calbet (LMC), Shape-Rényi complexity (SRC), Generalized Rényi complexity (GRC), Rényi complexity ratio (RCR) are considered in the analytical framework. Representative results are given for three one-electron atomic ions in tabular and graphical format. Changes in these measures with respect to parity and Dunkl parameter have been given in detail. Most of these results are offered here for the first time.

Abstract:
Although the original EPR paradox was formulated in terms of position and momentum, most studies of these phenomena have focused on measurement scenarios with only a discrete number of possible measurement outcomes. Here, we present a framework for studying non-locality that is agnostic to the dimension of the physical systems involved, allowing us to probe purely continuous-variable, discrete-variable, or hybrid non-locality. Our approach allows us to find the optimal Bell inequality for any given measurement scenario and quantifies the amount of non-locality that is present in measurement statistics. This formalism unifies the existing literature on continuous-variable non-locality and allows us to identify new states in which Bell non-locality can be probed through homodyne detection. Notably, we find the first example of continuous-variable non-locality that cannot be mapped to a CHSH Bell inequality. Moreover, we provide several examples of simple hybrid DV-CV entangled states that could lead to near-term violation of Bell inequalities.

Abstract:
Tegmark's widely cited bound on decoherence times in biological systems is derived under the assumption of a delta correlated, memoryless environment. In this work we show that any finite environmental memory universally induces quadratic short time decoherence, in validating the exponential decay law at early times. For an Ornstein Uhlenbeck environment we derive a closed non markovian expression for the coherence dynamics and obtain a de-coherence time that scales as the square root of the bath correlation time. In the singular limit of vanishing bath memory our result reduces exactly to Tegmark's bound. Numerical simulations based on an exact pseudomode mapping confirm the predicted scaling. These findings demonstrate that Tegmark's result applies only in the Markovian limit and does not rule out mesoscopic quantum coherence in structured biological media.

Abstract:
This research presents a novel approach in quantum computing by transforming ARM assembly instructions for use in quantum algorithms. The core achievement is the development of a method to directly map the ARM assembly language, a staple in classical computing, to quantum computing paradigms. The practical application of this methodology is demonstrated through the computation of the Fibonacci sequence. This example serves to validate the approach and underscores its potential in simplifying quantum algorithms. Grover's Algorithm was realized through the use of quantum-specific instructions. These transformations were developed as part of an open-source assembly-to-quantum compiler (github.com/arhaverly/AssemblyToQuantumCompiler). This effort introduces a novel approach to utilizing classical instruction sets in quantum computing and offers insight into potential future developments in the field. The AssemblyToQuantumCompiler streamlines quantum programming and enables computer scientists to transition more easily from classical to quantum computer programming.

Abstract:
The transition to the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) presents a computational challenge where particle reconstruction complexity may outpace classical computing resources. While quantum computing offers potential speedups, standard algorithms like Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) require prohibitive circuit depths for near-term hardware. Here, we introduce the 1-Bit Quantum Filter, a domain-specific adaptation of HHL that reformulates tracking from matrix inversion to binary ground-state filtering. By replacing high-precision phase estimation with a single-ancilla spectral threshold and exploiting the Hamiltonian's sparsity, we achieve an asymptotic gate complexity of $O(\sqrt{N} \log N)$, given Hamiltonian dimension $N$. We validate this approach by simulating LHCb Vertex Locator events with a toy model, and benchmark performance using the noise models of Quantinuum H2 trapped-ion and IBM Heron superconducting processors. This work establishes a resource-efficient track reconstruction method capable of solving realistic event topologies on noise-free simulators and smaller tracking scenarios within the current constraints of the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era.

Abstract:
We analyze the interplay of disorder and long-range hopping in a paradigmatic one dimensional model of quantum transport. While typically the current is expected to decrease as the disorder strength increases due to localization effects, in systems with infinite range hopping it was shown in Chavez et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 153201 (2021), that the current can increase with disorder in the Disorder-Enhanced-Transport (DET) regime. Here, by analyzing models with variable hopping range decaying as $1/r^α$ with the distance $r$ among the sites, we show that the DET regime is a general feature of long-range hopping systems and it occurs, not only in the strong long-range limit $α<1$ but even for weak long-range $1 \le α\le 3$. Specifically, we show that, after an initial decrease, the current grows with the disorder strength until it reaches a local maximum. Both disorder thresholds at which the DET regime starts and ends are determined. Our results open the path to understand the effect of disorder on transport in many realistic systems where long range hopping is present.

Abstract:
Non-stabilizerness, also known as ``magic,'' quantifies how far a quantum state departs from the stabilizer set. It is a central resource behind quantum advantage and a useful probe of the complexity of many-body quantum states. Yet standard magic quantifiers, such as the stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE) for qubits and the mana for qutrits, are costly to evaluate numerically, with the computational complexity growing rapidly with the number $N$ of qudits. Here we introduce efficient, numerically exact algorithms that exploit the fast Hadamard transform to compute the SRE for qubits ($d=2$) and the mana for qutrits ($d=3$) for pure states given as state vectors. Our methods reduce the runtime to $O(N d^{2N})$, an exponential improvement over the naive $O(d^{3N})$ scaling, while exposing substantial parallelism and enabling GPU acceleration. We further show how to combine the fast Hadamard transform with Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the SRE of state vectors, and we extend the approach to compute the mana of mixed states. All algorithms are implemented in the open-source Julia package HadaMAG.jl, which provides a high-performance, GPU-enabled toolbox for computing SRE and mana. The package, together with the methods developed in this work, offers a practical route to large-scale numerical studies of magic in quantum many-body systems.

Abstract:
Hybrid quantum systems combine the unique advantages of different physical platforms with the goal of realizing more powerful and practical quantum information processing devices. Mechanical systems, such as bulk acoustic wave resonators, feature a large number of highly coherent harmonic modes in a compact footprint, which complements the strong nonlinearities and fast operation times of superconducting quantum circuits. Here, we demonstrate an architecture for mechanical resonator-based quantum computing, in which a superconducting qubit is used to perform quantum gates on a collection of mechanical modes. We show the implementation of a universal gate set, composed of single-qubit gates and controlled arbitrary-phase gates, and showcase their use in the quantum Fourier transform and quantum period finding algorithms. These results pave the way toward using mechanical systems to build crucial components for future quantum technologies, such as quantum random-access memories.

Abstract:
Understanding and quantifying causal relationships between variables is essential for reasoning about the physical world. In this work, we develop a resource-theoretic framework to do so. Here, we focus on the simplest nontrivial setting -- two variables that are causally ordered, meaning that the first has the potential to influence the second, without hidden confounding. First, we introduce the resource theory that directly quantifies causal influence of a functional dependence in this setting and show that the problem of deciding convertibility of resources and identifying a complete set of monotones has a relatively straightforward solution. Following this, we introduce the resource theory that arises naturally when one has uncertainty about the functional dependence. We describe a linear program for deciding the question of whether one resource (i.e., state of knowledge about the functional dependence) can be converted to another. Then, we focus on the case where the variables are binary. In this case, we identify a triple of monotones that are complete in the sense that they capture the partial order over the set of all resources, and we provide an interpretation of each.

Abstract:
This note is a friendly technical check of arXiv:2511.21731v1. I highlight a few places where the manuscript's interpretation of (i) the reported CHSH/Bell-type calculations and (ii) Bose--Einstein (BE) fits to rank-frequency data seems to go beyond what the stated procedures can firmly support. I also point out one internal inconsistency in the "energy-level spacing" analogy. The aim is constructive: to keep the interesting empirical observations, while making clear what they do (and do not) imply about quantum entanglement in the usual Hilbert-space sense, especially when "energy" is defined by rank.

Abstract:
The rates of exciton transfer within dyads of perylene diimide and terrylene diimide connected by oligophenylene bridge units have been shown to deviate significantly from those of Förster's resonance energy transfer theory, according to single molecule spectroscopy experiments. The present work provides a detailed computational and theoretical study investigating the source of such discrepancy. Electronic spectroscopy data are calculated by time-dependent density function theory and then compared with experimental results. Electronic couplings between exciton donor and acceptor are estimated based on both transition density cube method and transition dipole approximation. These results confirm that the delocalization of exciton to the bridge parts contribute to significant enhancement of donor-acceptor electronic coupling. Mechanistic details of exciton transfer are examined by estimating the contributions of the bridge electronic states, vibrational modes of the dyads commonly coupled to both donor and acceptor, inelastic resonance energy transfer mechanism, and dark exciton states. These analyses suggest that the contribution of common vibrational modes serves as the main source of deviation from Förster's spectral overlap expression.

Abstract:
Quantum computing has become an active research field in recent years, as its applications in fields such as cryptography, optimization, and materials science are promising. Along with these developments, challenges and opportunities exist in the field of Quantum Software Engineering, as the development of frameworks and higher-level abstractions has attracted practitioners from diverse backgrounds. Unlike initial quantum frameworks based on the circuit model, recent frameworks and libraries leverage higher-level abstractions for creating quantum programs. This paper presents an empirical study of 985 Jupyter Notebooks from 80 open-source projects to investigate how quantum patterns are applied in practice. Our work involved two main stages. First, we built a knowledge base from three quantum computing frameworks (Qiskit, PennyLane, and Classiq). This process led us to identify and document 9 new patterns that refine and extend the existing quantum computing pattern catalog. Second, we developed a reusable semantic search tool to automatically detect these patterns across our large-scale dataset, providing a practitioner-focused analysis. Our results show that developers use patterns in three levels: from foundational circuit utilities, to common algorithmic primitives (e.g., Amplitude Amplification), up to domain-specific applications for finance and optimization. This indicates a maturing field where developers are increasingly using high-level building blocks to solve real-world problems.

Abstract:
We report on the creation of $^{86}$Sr$_2$ molecules in the halo state and neighboring weakly bound states. Efficient molecule production via one-photon photoassociation relies on sufficient wavefunction overlap between the target vibrational states in the electronic excited- and ground-state potentials. Using Autler-Townes spectroscopy, transition strengths are measured to identify optimal pathways for production of weakly bound molecules. Vibrational splittings for the three least-bound vibrational states are measured, and dominant systematic uncertainties are evaluated with uncertainties below 100 Hz. From these splittings, absolute binding energies for these weakly bound vibrational states are determined. The results pave the way to a molecular isotope shift measurement with Sr$_2$.

Abstract:
Rydberg atoms represent a platform underpinning many recent developments in quantum computation, simulation, sensing, and metrology. They further facilitate optical nonlinearity at the single-photon level when coupled to photons propagating in atomic clouds, which form collective atomic excitations called Rydberg polaritons, strongly interacting with each other. Here, we experimentally explore interactions between a Rydberg polariton in an atomic ensemble and a single, adjacent, Rydberg atom. We discover three different regimes of quantum dynamics corresponding to polariton blockade, coherent exchange, and probabilistic hopping, which are defined by their distinct transmission characteristics, with a transition through an exceptional point occurring between blockade and coherent exchange. We investigate the applications of such interactions for fast, non-destructive detection of Rydberg atoms and present proof-of-principle demonstrations for their potential application in nonlinear photonic networks.

Abstract:
In many-body quantum systems, interactions drive the emergence of correlations that are at the heart of the most intriguing states of matter. A remarkable example is the case of weakly interacting bosonic systems, whose ground state is a squeezed vacuum state, and whose elementary excitations have a collective nature. In this work, we report on the direct observation of the peculiar microscopic quantum structure of these elementary excitations. We perform time- and frequency-resolved two-photon correlation measurements on the fluctuations of weakly interacting polaritons in a resonantly-driven microcavity, and observe that upon decreasing the average number of fluctuation quanta below unity, large pair correlations build up together with strong time-ordering of the emitted photons. This behavior is a direct signature of the particle-hole quantum superposition which is at the heart of Bogoliubov excitations.

Abstract:
We propose the first algorithms with non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for computing the Petz-Augustin capacity, which generalizes the channel capacity and characterizes the optimal error exponent in classical-quantum channel coding. This capacity can be equivalently expressed as the maximization of two generalizations of mutual information: the Petz-Rényi information and the Petz-Augustin information. To maximize the Petz-Rényi information, we show that it corresponds to a convex Hölder-smooth optimization problem, and hence the universal fast gradient method of Nesterov (2015), along with its convergence guarantees, readily applies. Regarding the maximization of the Petz-Augustin information, we adopt a two-layered approach: we show that the objective function is smooth relative to the negative Shannon entropy and can be efficiently optimized by entropic mirror descent; each iteration of entropic mirror descent requires computing the Petz-Augustin information, for which we propose a novel fixed-point algorithm and establish its contractivity with respect to the Thompson metric. Notably, this two-layered approach can be viewed as a generalization of the mirror-descent interpretation of the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm due to He et al. (2024).

Abstract:
We report a comprehensive experimental study of spontaneous Brillouin scattering in a few-mode optical fiber, resolving both forward and backward scattering processes for intra- and inter-modal interactions. Using heterodyne detection, Stokes and anti-Stokes components without external acoustic excitation are observed and quantitatively extracted Brillouin shifts, linewidths, and gain coefficients. Forward scattering is mediated by guided torsional-radial acoustic modes with frequencies ranging from MHz to GHz, while backward scattering involves longitudinal core-guided modes at frequencies of tens of GHz. These results provide calibrated benchmarks for Brillouin interactions in few-mode fibers, offering insights relevant to phonon-based quantum applications and mode-selective optomechanics.

Abstract:
Vortex light, a unique optical field that carries orbital angular momentum (OAM), has attracted considerable attention in recent years. In this paper, we present a detailed theoretical analysis of OAM transfer from the input field to the generated signal field in a four-level double-Lambda system via the four-wave mixing (FWM) process, showing that their OAMs follow a specific algebraic relationship. We identify the optimal conditions for efficient vortex light transmission, analyze the influence of detuning on transmission efficiency and phase distortion, and specifically examine the scenario where the control field carries OAM the latter being essential for a complete characterization of OAM conservation in the FWM process, while all three aspects have been largely overlooked in the existing literature. Furthermore, we investigated the tunability of the group velocity between the probe and signal fields by modulating the Rabi frequencies of the two control fields and the relative phase between the probe and signal fields during the FWM process. We demonstrate that the conversion between matched vortex slow and fast light can be realized an effect that has not been widely explored in dual-Lambda-type systems. These results may hold promise for applications in quantum information storage and processing, quantum computing, and ultrasensitive detection.

Abstract:
This chapter reexamines wave function realism (WFR) through the lens of phenomenology. We begin by situating WFR within the broader debate about the ontology of the quantum state and the temptation to "read off" metaphysics from mathematical formalism. Against this background, we turn to the London-Bauer interpretation (LBI), the most explicit attempt to interpret quantum mechanics through phenomenological categories. On this view, the measurement transition is not a physical discontinuity but a reflective articulation of objectivity, and the wave function formally encodes the horizonal structure of world-givenness. We develop this idea by reconfiguring the notion of realism itself: not as objectivist, but as correlational and transcendental. The resulting picture suggests that quantum mechanics, rather than depicting a world "minus observers," mathematically articulates the very correlation through which a world becomes manifest at all.

Abstract:
Skyrmions, topologically stable field configurations, have recently emerged in classical optics as structured light for high-density data applications. Achieving controllable on-chip generation of single-photon skyrmions, while being highly desirable for quantum information technologies, remains challenging due to the nanoscale confinement of quantum emitters (QEs). Here we demonstrate a metasurface-integrated quantum emitter (metaQE) platform enabling room-temperature on-chip generation of single-photon skyrmions. Near-field coupling between QEs and propitiously designed surface arrays of meta-atoms mediates spin-orbit interaction, transforming nanoscale-localized dipole emission into free-propagating topologically structured photonic modes. By exploiting this approach for structuring quantum emission from different color centers in nanodiamonds, we realize diverse skyrmionic states, including high-order anti-skyrmions and skyrmionium, and thereby demonstrate its universality across QEs. Our work establishes a unified framework for on-chip structured quantum light sources, offering versatile control of high-dimensional topological states, such as skyrmions, and advancing scalable quantum photonic technologies.

Abstract:
Large language models (LLMs) can be adapted to new tasks using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods that modify only a small number of trainable parameters, often through low-rank updates. In this work, we adopt a quantum-information-inspired perspective to understand their effectiveness. From this perspective, low-rank parameterizations naturally correspond to low-dimensional Matrix Product States (MPS) representations, which enable entanglement-based characterizations of parameter structure. Thereby, we term and measure "Artificial Entanglement", defined as the entanglement entropy of the parameters in artificial neural networks (in particular the LLMs). We first study the representative low-rank adaptation (LoRA) PEFT method, alongside full fine-tuning (FFT), using LLaMA models at the 1B and 8B scales trained on the Tulu3 and OpenThoughts3 datasets, and uncover: (i) Internal artificial entanglement in the updates of query and value projection matrices in LoRA follows a volume law with a central suppression (termed as the "Entanglement Valley"), which is sensitive to hyper-parameters and is distinct from that in FFT; (ii) External artificial entanglement in attention matrices, corresponding to token-token correlations in representation space, follows an area law with logarithmic corrections and remains robust to LoRA hyper-parameters and training steps. Drawing a parallel to the No-Hair Theorem in black hole physics, we propose that although LoRA and FFT induce distinct internal entanglement signatures, such differences do not manifest in the attention outputs, suggesting a "no-hair" property that results in the effectiveness of low rank updates. We further provide theoretical support based on random matrix theory, and extend our analysis to an MPS Adaptation PEFT method, which exhibits qualitatively similar behaviors.

Abstract:
The Levin-Wen string-net formalism provides a canonical mapping from spherical fusion categories to local Hamiltonians defining Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs). While the topological invariance of the ground state is guaranteed by the pentagon identity, the realization of the model on a physical Hilbert space requires the category to be unitary. In this work, we investigate the obstructions arising when this construction is applied to non-unitary spherical categories, specifically the Yang-Lee model (the non-unitary minimal model $\mathcal{M}(2,5)$). We first validate our framework by explicitly constructing and verifying the Hamiltonians for rank-3 ($\text{Rep}(D_3)$), rank-5 ($\text{TY}(\mathbb{Z}_4)$), and Abelian ($\mathbb{Z}_7$) unitary categories. We then apply this machinery to the non-unitary Yang-Lee model. Using a custom gradient-descent optimization algorithm on the manifold of $F$-symbols, we demonstrate that the Yang-Lee fusion rules admit no unitary solution to the pentagon equations. We explain this failure analytically by proving that negative quantum dimensions impose an indefinite metric on the string-net space, realizing a Krein space rather than a Hilbert space. Finally, we invoke the theory of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum mechanics to interpret the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, establishing that the obstruction is intrinsic to the fusion ring and cannot be removed by unitary gauge transformations.

Abstract:
We propose a theoretical scheme for controlling the Goos-Hänchen shift (GHS) of a reflected probe field in a polariton optomechanical system. The system comprises an optical mode, a molecular vibrational mode, and $N$ excitonic modes, where excitons couple to molecular vibrations via conditional displacement interactions and to photons through electric dipole interactions. We show that the effective exciton-vibration coupling provides a powerful mechanism for coherent GHS control: in its absence, the system exhibits a pronounced GHS at resonance, while activating it strongly suppresses the shift. The effective cavity detuning and the cavity length serve as additional tunable parameters for GHS manipulation. Furthermore, increasing the collective exciton-optical coupling enhances the GHS. Our results establish a framework for probing the GHS in polariton optomechanical systems and offer new avenues for designing optical devices that exploit beam-displacement phenomena.

Abstract:
Neural quantum states (NQS) have proven highly effective in representing quantum many-body wavefunctions, but their loss landscape remains poorly understood and debated. Here, we demonstrate that the NQS loss landscape is more benign and similar to conventional deep learning than previously thought, exhibiting mode connectivity: independently trained NQS are connected by paths in parameter space with essentially no energy barrier. To construct these paths, we develop GeoNEB, a path optimizer integrating efficient stochastic reconfiguration with the nudged elastic band method for constructing minimum energy paths. For the strongly interacting six-electron quantum dot modeled by a $1.6$M-parameter Psiformer, we find two independent minima with expected energy barrier $\sim10^{-5}$ times smaller than the system's overall energy scale and $\sim10^{-3}$ times smaller than the linear path's barrier. The path respects physical symmetry in addition to achieving low energy, with the angular momentum remaining well quantized throughout. Our work is the first to construct optimized paths between independently trained NQS, and it suggests that the NQS loss landscape may not be as pathological as once feared.

Abstract:
We propose the gravitational analog of the chiroptical effect for the first time, demonstrating that gravitational waves (GWs) can induce a reversal of photon chirality through the exchange of angular momentum, namely the spin-2-gravitation chiroptical effect. By analyzing the interaction between photon spin angular momentum (SAM) and GWs, we derive the selection rules governing this exchange, which are strictly dictated by the spin-1 and spin-2 nature of the electromagnetic and gravitational fields, respectively. We find that the gravitational chiroptical effect reflects the local nature of SAM which prevents the accumulation of gravitational perturbations over spatial phase windings, and offers a theoretically rigorous tool to probe the chiral structure of GWs. This mechanism provides a novel observational pathway to constrain modified gravity theories, measure the asymmetric properties of compact binaries, and explore parity-violating physics in the early universe.

Abstract:
We consider the problem of Bose-Einstein condensed atoms, which are confined in a (quasi) one-dimensional toroidal potential. We focus on the case of an effective attractive interaction between the atoms. The formation of a localized blob (i.e., a ``bright" solitary wave) for sufficiently strong interactions provides an example of spontaneous symmetry breaking. We evaluate analytically and numerically the excitation spectrum for both cases of a homogeneous and of a localized density distribution. We identify in the excitation spectrum the emergence of the analogous to the Goldstone and the Higgs modes, evaluating various relevant observables, gaining insight into these two fundamental modes of excitation.

Abstract:
Topological kagome magnets offer a rich landscape for exploring the intricate interplay of quantum interactions among geometry, topology, spin, and correlation. GdTi3Bi4 crystallizes in layered Ti based kagome nets intertwined with zigzag Gd chains along the a axis and orders antiferromagnetically below 15 K. Here, we present the temperature and field dependent electrical transport of GdTi3Bi4 in different directions. The material exhibits anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) of 410 S cm-1 at 2 K for B parallel c and it is completely absent for B parallel a, despite the similar magnetization observed in both orientations. This behavior is quite contradictory, as anomalous Hall effect (AHE) typically scales with the magnetization. Through first principles calculations, it is demonstrated that in the presence of time reversal symmetry broken by the Gd 4f sublattice and spin orbit coupling, the magnetization direction controls the orbital mixing in the Ti t2g bands, relocating Berry curvature hot spots and producing the observed orientation selective AHC. The results establish GdTi3Bi4 as platform for investigating new avenues of AHE, such as directional AHE, and thus shed new light on the intricate coupling between magnetic and electronic structures, paving the way for exploring novel quantum phenomena.

Abstract:
Clock transitions are well known in atomic and solid-state systems, but are largely unexplored in molecular liquids. Here we demonstrate a clock-like, nuclear-spin avoided crossing in [1--$^{13}$C]-fumarate that supports long-lived and directly observable coherences at ultralow magnetic field: a three-spin transition $|S_0α\rangle \leftrightarrow |T_{+1}β\rangle$ near 400 nT exhibits a shallow crossing with a frequency minimum of 2 Hz. The transition is first-order immune to magnetic field perturbations and displays a lifetime of 25 s, around three times the longest single-spin $T_2^*$. Sensitivity to effective pseudo-fields is also demonstrated, including the internal dipolar field of the sample.

Abstract:
We investigate superconducting transmission lines as a novel platform for realizing a quantum fluid of microwave photons in a propagating geometry. We predict that the strong photon-photon interactions provided by the intrinsic nonlinearity of Josephson junctions are sufficient to enter a regime of strongly interacting photons for realistic parameters. A suitable tapering of the transmission line parameters allows for the adiabatic conversion of an incident coherent field into a Tonks-Girardeau gas of fermionized photons close to its ground state. Signatures of the strong correlations are anticipated in the correlation properties of the transmitted light.

Abstract:
Most numerical methods for time integration use real-valued time steps. Complex time steps, however, can provide an additional degree of freedom, as we can select the magnitude of the time step in both the real and imaginary directions. We show that specific paths in the complex time plane lead to expanded stability regions, providing clear computational advantages for complex-valued systems. In particular, we highlight the Schrödinger equation, for which complex time integrators can be uniquely optimal. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these benefits extend to certain classes of real-valued stiff systems by coupling complex time steps with the Projective Integration method.

Abstract:
We investigate the superradiant phase transition in a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate with distinct atomic detunings, confined in an optical cavity and driven by a transverse pump laser. By combining perturbation theory and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the phase transition is dominated by the red-detuned component, resulting in a phase diagram completely different from that of a single-component case under blue-detuned condition. The system exhibits spontaneous phase separation between the two components, manifested as alternating stripe patterns in the normal phase and distinct Bragg gratings in the superradiant phase. Furthermore, the Bogoliubov excitation spectrum reveals roton-type mode softening, indicating that the phase transition also corresponds to the superfluid-to-lattice supersolid transition. Our findings provide insights into the interplay between atomic detunings and collective quantum many-body phenomena, offering potential applications in quantum simulation and optical switching technologies.

Abstract:
Analog coprocessors are intensively developing nowadays with the aim to optimize energy computations of neural networks. In this work we focus on the possibility of using detection of collective oscillations in optical systems for computational purposes. We show that in a system of coupled resonators, collective oscillations can be used to implement matrix-vector multiplication. The matrix is formed by the coupling constants between the resonators, and the input vector is formed by the initial occupancies of the involved modes. The frequency of the collective oscillations is growing with the number of the involved modes, similarly to Rabi oscillations. The time needed for their detection, i.e., averaging, decreases with an increase in the input vector dimension. We discuss the limitations imposed on parallel computation in the system by restriction of the allowed optical frequency band.

Abstract:
We demonstrate a fundamental relation between the structures of physical space and of quantum theory: the set of quantum correlations in a rotational prepare-and-measure scenario can be derived from covariance alone, without assuming quantum physics. To show this, we consider a semi-device-independent randomness generation scheme where one of two spatial rotations is performed on an otherwise uncharacterized preparation device, and one of two possible measurement outcomes is subsequently obtained. An upper bound on a theory-independent notion of spin is assumed for the transmitted physical system. It turns out that this determines the set of quantum correlations and the amount of certifiable randomness in this setup exactly. Interestingly, this yields the basis of a theory-independent protocol for the secure generation of random numbers. Our results support the conjecture that the symmetries of space and time determine at least part of the probabilistic structure of quantum theory.

Abstract:
The advent of quantum computing necessitates the transition of worldwide cryptosystems to post-quantum cryptography (PQC), which is founded upon the problem of finding short vectors in high-dimensional structured lattices. It is assumed that the structure of these lattices cannot be exploited by quantum or classical algorithms attempting to find short vectors. In this work, we focus on the structure of the lattices used in PQC protocols - nega-cyclic (and cyclic)lattices - and provide a quantum algorithmic framework that efficiently encodes the structured lattices into Hamiltonians by exploiting their underlying symmetries. The efficient encoding substantially reduces the dimension of the corresponding Hilbert space by limiting it to a relevant subspace where short vectors are likely to be found - leading to significant savings in quantum resources (e.g. qubit count and circuit depth) required to implement a quantum algorithm for finding short vectors. We analytically prove the efficient encoding procedure and benchmark the proposed framework using the variational quantum eigensolver, demonstrating improved results with reduced quantum resources.

Abstract:
The paper by C. Bradac et al. [Nat. Commun. 8, 1205 (2017)] discusses room-temperature superradiance from NV color centers in diamonds. It presents a new model intended to reflect experimental characteristics of this phenomenon. To validate the model, the authors provide experimental results that are subsequently compared with numerical calculations derived from the scheme. Motivated by our own experiments with the fluorescence of similar NV samples, we attempted to create a theoretical model to accurately describe experimental systems. Initially, we aimed to incorporate the numerical equations from Bradac et al.'s paper's supplement into our own theoretical framework. However, we encountered numerous issues resulting in non-physical results such as negative photon counts or non-zero asymptotic fluorescence intensity. We identified these inconsistencies and proposed amendments to rectify them. We have developed our own framework by correctly reinterpreting the terms of the master equation. The resulting formulas produce physically meaningful results consistent with experimental data.

Abstract:
Recent research has shown that syndrome-based belief propagation using layered scheduling (sLBP) can not only accelerate the convergence rate but also improve the error rate performance by breaking the quantum trapping sets for quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes, showcasing a result distinct from classical error correction codes. In this paper, we consider edge-wise informed dynamic scheduling (IDS) for QLDPC codes based on syndrome-based residual belief propagation (sRBP). However, the construction of QLDPC codes and the identical prior intrinsic information assignment will result in an equal residual in many edges, causing a performance limitation for sRBP. Two heuristic strategies, including edge pool design and error pre-correction, are introduced to tackle this obstacle and quantum trapping sets. Then, a novel sRBP equipped with a predict-and-reduce-error mechanism (PRE-sRBP) is proposed, which can provide over one order of performance gain on the considered bicycle codes and symmetric hypergraph (HP) code under similar iterations compared to sLBP.

Abstract:
Quantum states can be written in infinitely many ways depending on the choices of basis. Schmidt decomposition of a quantum state has a lot of properties useful in the study of entanglement. All bipartite states admit Schmidt decomposition, but this does not extend to multipartite systems. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of Schmidt decompositions of multipartite states. Moreover, we provide an efficient algorithm to obtain the decomposition for a Schmidt decomposable multipartite state.

Abstract:
Quantum technologies offer ways to solve certain tasks more quickly, efficiently, and with greater precision than their classical counterparts. Yet substantial challenges remain in the construction of sufficiently error-free and scalable quantum platforms needed to unlock any real benefits to society. Acknowledging that this hardware can take vastly different forms, our review here focuses on so-called spintronic (\textit{i.e.}~spin-electronic) materials that use electronic or nuclear spins to embody qubits. Towards helping the reader to spot trends and pick winners, we have surveyed the various families of optically addressable spin qubits and attempted to benchmark and identify the most promising ones in each. We go on to reveal further trends that demonstrate how qubit lifetimes depend on the material's synthesis, the concentration/distribution of its embedded qubits, and the experimental conditions.

Abstract:
We theoretically investigated the mechanism of quantum entanglement between the spin of photoelectrons and linear polarization of emitted X-ray photons in the 3$d\rightarrow\ $2$p$ XEPECS process for $\rm Ti_{2}O_{3}$. In the calculation, we used a realistic $\rm TiO_{6}$-type cluster model with the full multiplet structure of the Ti ion and the charge-transfer effect between the Ti 3$d$ and ligand O 2$p$ orbitals. We found that quantum entanglement occurs between the spin of photoelectrons and linear polarization of emitted X-ray photons and that it depends on the angular geometry in the XEPECS process. In addition, we found that the degree of spin and polarization entanglement decreases as the Ti 3$d\ $- O 2$p$ hybridization becomes stronger and as the crystal field modifies the electronic states in terms of the tangle, an index for the degree of entanglement. These results highlight the crucial role of the charge transfer and crystal field effects in determining entanglement properties in real material systems.

Abstract:
Magnetic impurities are known to degrade superconductivity. For this reason, physical vapor deposition chambers that have previously been used for magnetic materials have generally been avoided for making high-quality superconducting resonator devices. In this article, we show by example that such chambers can be used for this purpose; with Nb films sputtered in a chamber that continues to be used for magnetic materials, we demonstrate compact (\SI{3}{\micro\meter} gap) coplanar waveguide resonators with low-power internal quality factors near one million. We achieve this using a resist strip bath with no post-fabrication acid treatment, which results in performance comparable to previous strip baths with acid treatments. We also find evidence that this improved resist strip bath provides a better surface chemical template for post-fabrication hydrogen fluoride processing. These results are consistent across three Si substrate preparation methods, including a \SI{700}{\celsius} anneal. These results will inform nanofabrication for other superconducting materials and the integration of magnetic materials for hybrid systems.

Abstract:
The advection-diffusion equation is simulated on a superconducting quantum computer via several quantum algorithms. Three formulations are considered: (1) Trotterization, (2) variational quantum time evolution (VarQTE), and (3) adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulation (AVQDS). These schemes were originally developed for the Hamiltonian simulation of many-body quantum systems. The finite-difference discretized operator of the transport equation is formulated as a Hamiltonian and solved without the need for ancillary qubits. Computations are conducted on a quantum simulator (IBM Qiskit Aer) and an actual quantum hardware (IBM Fez). The former emulates the latter without the noise. The predicted results are compared with direct numerical simulation (DNS) data with infidelities of the order $10^{-5}$. In the quantum simulator, Trotterization is observed to have the lowest infidelity and is suitable for fault-tolerant computation. The AVQDS algorithm requires the lowest gate count and the lowest circuit depth. The VarQTE algorithm is the next best in terms of gate counts, but the number of its optimization variables is directly proportional to the number of qubits. Due to current hardware limitations, Trotterization cannot be implemented, as it has an overwhelming large number of operations. Meanwhile, AVQDS and VarQTE can be executed, but suffer from large errors due to significant hardware noise. These algorithms present a new paradigm for computational transport phenomena on quantum computers.

Abstract:
Quantum Graph Neural Networks (QGNNs) offer a promising approach to combining quantum computing with graph-structured data processing. While classical Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are scalable and robust, existing QGNNs often lack flexibility due to graph-specific quantum circuit designs, limiting their applicability to diverse real-world problems. To address this, we propose a versatile QGNN framework inspired by GraphSAGE, using quantum models as aggregators. We integrate inductive representation learning techniques with parameterized quantum convolutional and pooling layers, bridging classical and quantum paradigms. The convolutional layer is flexible, allowing tailored designs for specific tasks. Benchmarked on a node regression task with the QM9 dataset, our framework, using a single minimal circuit for all aggregation steps, handles molecules with varying numbers of atoms without changing qubits or circuit architecture. While classical GNNs achieve higher training performance, our quantum approach remains competitive and often shows stronger generalization as molecular complexity increases. We also observe faster learning in early training epochs. To mitigate trainability limitations of a single-circuit setup, we extend the framework with multiple quantum aggregators on QM9. Assigning distinct circuits to each hop substantially improves training performance across all cases. Additionally, we numerically demonstrate the absence of barren plateaus as qubit numbers increase, suggesting that the proposed model can scale to larger, more complex graph-based problems.

Abstract:
We describe our investigations concerning the sonification of measured data from experiments involving various mesoscopic mechanical oscillator systems cooled down close to their quantum ground states, and music generation from a programmed quantum computer that subjects a single quantum bit ("qubit") to various unitary rotations, composed in order to test for the breakdown of macroscopic realism as expressed by the violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality. "Listening'' to data via their resulting sonifications facilitates the discovery of signals that might otherwise be hard to detect in common graphic (i.e., visual) representations, and for the quantum computer music experiment provides a complementary way to discern when the measured qubit data violates macroscopic realism with some prior listening training. The resulting soundscapes and music also provide a complementary window into the quantum realm that is accessible to non-experts with open ears.

Abstract:
To utilize higher-dimensional quantum systems, in this Letter, we derive a generalized cross-resonance (GCR) scheme for realizing maximally entangling two-qutrit gates on fixed-frequency transmons beyond the 0-1 subspace. Our two-qutrit gates, namely, $U_{CR}^{01}$ and $U_{CR}^{12}$, acting on the $0{\text -}1$ and $1{\text -}2$ energy transitions of transmons, respectively, directly allow for entanglement on the $1{\text -}2$ levels. Unlike the known works, our gate is parametric in nature, enabling us to construct multiple entangling gates of interest. By performing simulations in Qiskit, we demonstrate two-qutrit generalized controlled-$X$ ($U_{CX}^{01}$ and $U_{CX}^{12}$) and controlled-$H$ ($U_{CH}^{01}$ and $U_{CH}^{12}$) gates, which are instances of the proposed $U_{CR}$ gates, with reported gate fidelities of $86.14\%~(99.73\%),~84.6\%~(97.88\%),~92.35\%~(99.39\%)$, and $91.99\%~(98.99\%)$, respectively with (and without) noise. We also reveal a two-qutrit Bell state with a fidelity of $99.06 \pm 0.01\%$, with a complete Bell state preparation in a $\sim514$ ns pulse sequence, which is less than the gate time of the known scheme by cross-Kerr-based entangling gates.

Abstract:
So far, certifying quantum devices from their input-output statistics, under minimal assumptions, required the preparation of specific pure quantum states. Recently, Xu et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 140201 (2024)] have demonstrated that certain sets of quantum observables can be certified using any state of full rank. However, their method is restricted to ideal conditions. Here, we address this problem and present an experimentally robust method that eliminates the need of preparing states with high fidelity with respect to specific pure states. We demonstrate the feasibility of the method by experimentally certifying photonic devices implementing Peres' set of 24 ququart observables [J. Phys. A 24, L175 (1991)] and Yu and Oh's set of 13 qutrit observables [Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 030402 (2012)], using maximally mixed states as input. This approach offers a crucial advantage for certifying high-dimensional quantum systems, since it works with maximally mixed and thermal states.

Abstract:
We examine the two-party perfect quantum teleportation of an unknown 1-qubit state in the case of sharing various 3-qubit entangled states between a sender and a receiver: GHZ state, W state and W-like state. We give an impossibility proof that the W state cannot be used as the sharing state to realize the perfect quantum teleportation for transmitting an arbitrary 1-qubit state, in sharp contrast with the GHZ state which is well known to realize the perfect quantum transportation. Moreover, we give a procedure of obtaining a modified entangled state which we call the W-like state to achieve the perfect quantum transportation under a prescribed measurement basis.

Abstract:
Quantum advantage schemes probe the boundary between classically simulatable and classically intractable quantum dynamics. We explore the impact of mid-circuit measurements on the computational power of quantum circuits. To this effect, we focus on quantum sampling and introduce a constant-depth measurement-driven approach for efficiently sampling from a broad class of commuting diagonal quantum circuits and associated structured phase states, previously requiring polynomial-depth unitary circuits. By interleaving mid-circuit measurements with feed-forward in randomized "fan-out staircases", our dynamical circuits bypass Lieb-Robinson light-cone constraints, enabling global entanglement with flexible auxiliary qubit usage on bounded-degree lattices (e.g., two-dimensional grids). The generated phase states exhibit random-matrix statistics and anti-concentration comparable to fully random architectures. We further demonstrate measurement-driven feature maps that distinguish phases of an extended SSH model from random eigenstates in a quantum machine-learning benchmark (reservoir computing). Technologically, our results harness mid-circuit measurements to realize quantum advantages on bounded-degree hardware with a favorable topology. Conceptually, they provide complexity-theoretic support for quantum speedups by mid-circuit measurements.

Abstract:
The laws of thermodynamics are a cornerstone of physics. At the nanoscale, where fluctuations and quantum effects matter, there is no unique thermodynamic framework because thermodynamic quantities such as heat and work depend on the accessibility of the degrees of freedom. We derive a thermodynamic framework for coherently driven systems, where the output light is assumed to be accessible. The resulting second law of thermodynamics is strictly tighter than the conventional one and it demands the output light to be more noisy than the input light. We illustrate our framework across several well-established models and we show how the three-level maser can be understood as an engine that reduces the noise of a coherent drive. Our framework opens a new avenue for investigating the noise properties of driven-dissipative quantum systems.

Abstract:
We propose a low-pass-filter (LPF) feedback control for cooling a trapped particle with a low-pass filter, which utilizes a shift of the potential caused by the feedback operation. By incorporating this shift in the energy cost function, we show that the LPF control can achieve the minimum phonon occupation number that is lower than cold damping with a band-pass filter, that with delayed feedback, and linear--quadratic--Gaussian (LQG) control, the last two of which are the standard methods of ground-state cooling of a levitated nanoparticle. For the detection efficiency of $90\%$, the achievable phonon occupation number with the LPF control is about one third, two fifths and one half of that of cold damping with a band-pass filter, that with delayed feedback, and LQG control, respectively. Thus our method has a decisive advantage to reach the absolute ground state.

Abstract:
Unitary errors, such as those arising from fault-tolerant compilation of quantum algorithms, systematically bias observable estimates. Correcting this bias typically requires additional resources, such as an increased number of non-Clifford gates. In this work, we present an alternative method for correcting bias in the expectation values of observables. The method leverages a decomposition of the ideal quantum channel into a probabilistic mixture of noisy quantum channels. Using this decomposition, we construct unbiased estimators as weighted sums of expectation values obtained from the noisy channels. We provide a detailed analysis of the method, identify the conditions under which it is effective, and validate its performance through numerical simulations. In particular, we demonstrate unbiased observable estimation in the presence of unitary errors by simulating the time dynamics of the Ising Hamiltonian. Our strategy offers a resource-efficient way to reduce the impact of unitary errors, improving methods for estimating observables in noisy near-term quantum devices and fault-tolerant implementation of quantum algorithms.

Abstract:
Photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) manifests as a forward-backward asymmetry of electron emission in the direction orthogonal to the light polarization plane via one-photon ionization of chiral molecules with circularly polarized light. Multi-polar `PECD' currents, i.e., currents resolved along multiple directions, have also been predicted using two mutually-orthogonal linearly polarized light with carrier frequencies $ω$ and $2ω$. These currents arise from the interference between the one- and two-photon transitions. Here, we will show that photoelectron spin detection already reveals enantio-sensitive multi-polar currents in the one-photon regime since the two axes can be marked by the photoelectron momentum $\unitvec{k}$ and spin-detection axis $\unitvec{s}$. Specifically, we consider one-photon ionization of an isotropic ensemble of randomly oriented chiral molecules and show that the direction of the resulting photoelectron current is enantio-sensitively `locked' to the photoelectron's spin, which is mediated by two mechanisms. First, is the Bloch pseudovector which enables a collinear locking forming either a spin-sink or source for opposite enantiomers. Second, is the spin torque pseudovector that enables orthogonal locking forming a spin vortex in the polarization plane that rotates in opposite directions for opposite enantiomers. The former effect is a spin analog of photoelectron vortex dichroism (\href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.129.233201}{Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{129}, 233201, 2022}) wherein the detected photoelectron spin encodes molecular chirality while the latter is reminiscent of the Rashba effect in solids

Abstract:
We investigate topological features in the synthetic Fock-state lattice (FSL) of a single-atom system described by the quantum Rabi model. By diagonalizing the Hamiltonian, we identify a zero-energy defect state localized at a domain wall of the FSL, whose spin polarization is topologically protected. To address the challenge of applying band topology to the FSL, we introduce a physically motivated and directly measurable topological invariant based on phase-space geometry-the phase-space winding number. We show that the Zak phase, computed using a phase-space parameter, is related to the invariant. This quantized geometric phase reflects the spin polarization of the defect state, demonstrating a bulk-boundary correspondence. The resulting phase-space topology reveals the emergence of single-atom dressed states with contrasting properties-topologically protected spin states and driving-tunable bosonic states. Our results establish phase-space topology as a novel framework for exploring topological physics in single-atom synthetic dimensions, uncovering quantum-unique topological protection distinct from classical analogs.

Abstract:
This study aims to address the nature of state change, measurement, and probabilistic outcomes in non-relativistic quantum mechanics. We consider a pair of particles that interact in a one-dimensional setting via a delta-function potential. One of the particles is confined to a one-dimensional box, and the other particle is free. The free particle is incident from the left with specified energy, and it may cause changes in state of the confined particle before flying away to the left or to the right. We present a formulation and computational scheme that avoids the use of perturbation theory and determines the probability of any such outcome as a function of the initial state of the confined particle and the energy of the incident particle. As demonstrated by a direct comparison, this presented method holds multiple advantages over a standard perturbative method. The problem formulation and corresponding computational scheme may have applications in physical settings which admit one-dimensional scattering, e.g., in the study of quantum wires or quantum dots.

Abstract:
We propose and validate a framework for analog simulation of the Heisenberg spin model using a circuit quantum electrodynamics (circuit-QED) platform. Our method involves the Dyson-Maleev transformation, for which we develop a procedure to circumvent its inherent non-Hermiticity, yielding the extended Bose-Hubbard (EBH) Hamiltonian. We demonstrate the equivalence of this approach to the Holstein-Primakoff encoding for spin-1/2 systems. For the experimental realization of this EBH model, we design a scalable circuit-QED architecture based on an engineered Josephson junction array. Numerical simulations confirm that the microwave photon dynamics in this simulator accurately reproduces the original spin dynamics. Our work establishes an experimentally accessible method for investigating complex quantum spin dynamics in a highly controllable bosonic setting.

Abstract:
Deep thermalisation -- where ensembles of pure states on a local subsystem, conditioned on measurement outcomes on its complement, approach universal maximum-entropy ensembles -- represents a stronger form of ergodicity than conventional thermalisation. We show that this framework fails dramatically for mixed initial states, evolved unitarily, even with infinitesimal initial mixedness. To address this, we introduce a new paradigm of deep thermalisation for mixed states, fundamentally distinct from that for pure-state ensembles. In our formulation, the deep thermal ensemble arises by tracing out auxiliary degrees of freedom from a maximum-entropy ensemble defined on an augmented system, with the ensemble structure depending explicitly on the entropy of the initial state. We demonstrate that such ensembles emerge dynamically in generic, locally interacting chaotic systems. For the self-dual kicked Ising chain, which we show to be exactly solvable for a class of mixed initial states, we find exact emergence of the so-defined mixed-state deep thermal ensemble at finite times. Our results therefore lead to fundamental insights into how maximum entropy principles and deep thermalisation manifest themselves in unitary dynamics of states with finite entropy.

Abstract:
Contrary to general relativity, quantum theory treats space and time in fundamentally different ways. In particular, while joint probabilities associated with spacelike separated measurements are defined in terms of the Born rule, joint probabilities associated with measurements performed in sequence are defined in terms of the state-update rule. In this work, we show that one obtains a more unified perspective of space and time in quantum theory by embracing a quasiprobabilistic description of sequential measurements. More precisely, we show that there exists a unique \emph{pseudo}-density operator encoding canonical quasiprobabilities associated with sequential measurements in precisely the same manner that a density operator encodes joint probabilities associated with spacelike separated measurements, thus providing a natural extension of the Born rule into the temporal domain. As an application, we show how such a spatiotemporal Born rule combined in conjunction with a quantum Bayes' rule yields an operational notion of time-reversal symmetry for sequential measurements on an \emph{open} quantum system.

We apply a measure of quantum state complexity for n-qubit systems, defined as the divergence between the Shannon or von Neumann entropy of the computational basis distribution and the second-order Renyi entropy. This quantity has already been used earlier termed as structural entropy and it is particularly powerful as the Renyi entropy is directly related to state purity, linear entropy, and the inverse participation ratio, providing a clear physical grounding. While other Renyi orders could be used, the second order offers a deep and established connection to these key physical quantities. We first validate the measure in canonical noise channels, showing it peaks at the boundary between quantum and classical regimes. We then demonstrate its power in many-body physics. For systems exhibiting a many-body localization transition - including deformed random matrix ensembles and a disordered Heisenberg spin chain - the complexity measure reliably signals the crossover from integrable/localized to quantum-chaotic/ergodic phases. Crucially, the maximum complexity occurs in the non-ergodic yet extended states at the transition, precisely capturing the critical region where the system is neither fully localized nor thermalized. Furthermore, within the chaotic phase, the measure correlates with the survival probability of local excitations, revealing a spectrum of thermalization properties. Our results establish that the entropic complexity is a simple, versatile, and effective probe for identifying nontrivial quantum regimes and transitions giving a new and alternative insight into such systems.

Abstract:
Quantifying the entangling capability of quantum operations is a fundamental task in quantum information science. Traditionally, this capability is measured by the entangling power (EP), defined as the average entanglement generated when a quantum operation acts uniformly on all possible product states. However, EP alone cannot capture the intricate input-state-dependent nature of entanglement generation. To address this, we define a complementary metric -- entangling power deviation (EPD) -- as the standard deviation of entanglement generated over all product input states, thereby capturing the multifaceted nature of entangling behavior. We develop a general group-theoretical framework that yields closed-form expressions for both EP and EPD. Our analysis shows that any nontrivial entangling operation necessarily exhibits input-state dependence: nonzero EP implies a nonzero EPD. By analyzing representative two-qubit gates, we show that the gates with identical EP can exhibit markedly different EPD values, illustrating that the nature of entanglement generation can significantly differ depending on the gate functionality. Extending our framework to a class of generalized controlled-unitary operations acting on bipartite Hilbert spaces of arbitrary dimensions, we further analyze the interplay between the entangling strength and uniformity, as quantified by EP and EPD. Moreover, we uncover a subtle dimension-parity-dependent behavior in entanglement generation, which EP alone fails to detect. These findings highlight EPD as an indispensable diagnostic tool -- one that, alongside EP, provides a deeper and more complete characterization of the entangling structure.

Abstract:
We consider a quantum algorithm for ground-state preparation based on a Chebyshev series approximation to the wall function. In a classical setting, this approach is appealing as it guarantees rapid convergence. We analyze the asymptotic scaling and success probabilities of different quantum implementations and provide numerical benchmarks, comparing the performance of the wall-Chebyshev projectors with current state-of-the-art approaches. We find that this approach requires fewer serial applications of the Hamiltonian oracle to achieve a given ground state fidelity, but is severely limited by exponentially decaying success probability. However, we find that some implementations maintain non-trivial success probability in regimes where wall-Chebyshev projection leads to a fidelity improvement over other approaches. As the wall-Chebyshev projector is highly robust to loose known upper bounds on the true ground state energy, it offers a potential resource trade-off, particulary in the early fault-tolerant regime of quantum computation.

Abstract:
Variational Quantum Computing (VQC) faces fundamental scalability barriers, primarily due to barren plateaus and sensitivity to quantum noise. To address these challenges, we introduce TensorHyper-VQC, a novel tensor-train (TT)-guided hypernetwork framework that significantly improves the robustness and scalability of VQC. Our framework fully delegates the generation of quantum circuit parameters to a classical TT network, effectively decoupling optimization from quantum hardware. This innovative parameterization mitigates gradient vanishing, enhances noise resilience through structured low-rank representations, and facilitates efficient gradient propagation. Grounded in Neural Tangent Kernel and statistical learning theory, our rigorous theoretical analyses establish strong guarantees on approximation capability, optimization stability, and generalization performance. Extensive empirical results across quantum dot classification, Max-Cut optimization, and molecular quantum simulation tasks demonstrate that TensorHyper-VQC consistently achieves superior performance and robust noise tolerance, including hardware-level validation on a 156-qubit IBM Heron processor. These results position TensorHyper-VQC as a scalable and noise-resilient framework for advancing practical quantum machine learning on near-term devices.

Abstract:
We show that the distance between two qubits coupled to a structured reservoir acts as a single geometric control that can store, revive, or suppress Bell nonlocality. In a mirror-terminated guide, quantum correlations lost to the bath return at discrete recurrence times, turning a product state into a Bell-violating one without any entangling drive (only local basis rotations/readout). In the continuum limit, we derive closed-form criteria for the emergence of nonlocality from backflow, and introduce a Bell-based analogue of the BLP measure to quantify this effect. We also show how subwavelength displacements away from a decoherence-free node quadratically reduce the lifetime of a dark state or bright state, enabling highly sensitive interferometric detection. All results rely on analytically solvable models and are compatible with current superconducting and nanophotonic platforms, offering a practical route to passive, geometry-controlled non-Markovian devices.

Abstract:
Periodic driving is used to steer physical systems to unique stationary states or nonequilibrium steady states (NESS), producing enhanced properties inaccessible to non-driven systems. For open quantum systems, characterizing the NESS is challenging and existing results are generally limited to specific types of driving and the Born-Markov approximation. Here we go beyond these limits by studying a generic periodically driven $ N$-level quantum system interacting with a low-density thermal gas. Exploiting the framework of Floquet scattering theory, we establish general Floquet thermalization conditions constraining the nature of the NESS and the transition rates. Moreover, we examine theoretically the structure of the NESS in the high temperature limit, and find out that the NESS complies, rather surprisingly, with an uniform probability distribution (predicted by the Boltzmann law) for any driving. Numerical calculations illustrate our theoretical elaborations for a simple toy model.

Abstract:
This study investigates quantum-enhanced parameter estimation through continuous monitoring in open quantum systems that exhibit a dissipative time crystal phase. We first analytically derive the global quantum Fisher information (QFI) rate for boundary time crystals (BTCs), demonstrating that within the time-crystal phase, the ultimate precision exhibits a cubic scaling with the system size, $f_{\mathrm{global}}\sim N^3$. We then generalize this finding to a broader class of dynamics, including the transverse collective dephasing (TCD) model, which achieves a time-crystal phase through a closing Liouvillian gap without requiring a dissipative phase transition. We proceed to numerically demonstrate that this maximal global QFI rate is experimentally attainable for both the BTC and TCD models, even at finite system sizes, via continuous homodyne and photodetection. Moving towards practical implementations, we analyze the precision limits under inefficient detection, revealing a critical difference: for BTC dynamics, inefficiencies asymptotically restore a classical scaling, and only a constant-factor quantum advantage remains possible. In contrast, for TCD dynamics, a super-classical scaling is still in principle observable, and our numerical simulations confirm its presence, even under inefficient measurement conditions, establishing the TCD model as a highly robust platform for quantum metrology.

Abstract:
Existing quantum routing implicitly mimics classical routing principles, with finding the ``best'' path (aka pathfinding), according to a selected routing metric, as a core mechanism for establishing end-to-end entanglement. However, optimal pathfinding is computationally intensive, particularly in complex topologies. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to quantum routing, which avoids the inherent overhead of conventional quantum pathfinding, by establishing directly entanglement between remote nodes. Our approach exploits graph complement strategies. It allows to improve the flexibility and efficiency of quantum networks, by paving the way for more practical quantum communication infrastructures.

Abstract:
The extraction of EPR pairs and n-qubits GHZ states among remote nodes in quantum networks constitutes the resource primitives for end-to-end and on-demand communications. However, the Bell-VM problem, which determines whether a given graph state can be transformed into a set of Bell pairs on specific vertices (not necessarily remote), is known to be NP-complete. In this paper, we extend this problem, not only by focusing on nodes remote within generic graph states, but also by determining the number of extractable n-qubit remote GHZ states -- beside the number of remote EPR pairs. The rationale for tackling the extraction of GHZ states among remote nodes, rather than solely remote EPR pairs, is that a GHZ state enables the dynamic extraction of an EPR pair between any pair of nodes sharing the state. This, in turn, implies the ability of accommodating the traffic requests on-the-fly. Specially, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm for solving the aforementioned NP-complete problem. Our results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to effectively adapt to generic graph states for extracting entanglement resources across remote nodes.

Abstract:
The quantum switch, a process enabling a coherent superposition of different orders of quantum channels, has garnered significant attention due to its ability to enable noiseless communications through noisy channels, such as entanglement-breaking channels. However, its practical implementation and scalability remain challenging. In contrast, the spatial superposition of quantum channels is more accessible experimentally and has been shown to enhance channel capacity, although it does not match the performance of the quantum switch. In this work, we present preliminary theoretical results demonstrating that, by applying tools of the quantum random walk framework to the spatial superposition of channels, it is possible to replicate the output of a quantum switch. These findings suggest a promising and more feasible route to emulate the quantum switch, offering both practical advantages and interpretative clarity.

Abstract:
We introduce a unified framework -- Quantum Neural Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations (QNODEs and QNPDEs) -- which extends the continuous-time formalism of classical neural ordinary and partial differential equations into quantum machine learning and quantum control. QNODEs denote the evolution of finite-dimensional quantum systems, whereas QNPDEs denote their infinite-dimensional (continuous-variable) counterparts; both are governed by generalised Schrödinger-type Hamiltonian dynamics, coupled with a corresponding loss function. This formalism permits gradient estimation via an adjoint-state method, facilitating efficient learning of quantum dynamics, and other dynamics that can be mapped (relatively easily) to quantum dynamics. Using this method, we present quantum algorithms for computing gradients with and without time discretisation, achieving efficient gradient computation that would otherwise be intractable on classical devices. We provide detailed resource estimates for these algorithms and investigate the local energy landscape for training. The formalism subsumes a wide array of applications, including quantum state preparation, Hamiltonian learning, learning dynamics in open systems, and the learning of both autonomous and non-autonomous classical ODEs and PDEs. In many cases of interest, the Hamiltonian is composed of a relatively small number of local operators, yet the corresponding classical simulation remains inefficient, making quantum approaches advantageous for gradient estimation. This continuous-time perspective can also serve as a blueprint for designing novel quantum neural network architectures, generalising discrete-layered models into continuous-depth models.

Abstract:
Advanced quantum-networking protocols beyond point-to-point links rely critically on the ability to perform multi-photon interference under realistic operating conditions. Yet experimental validation of such higher-order interference effects in deployed metropolitan fiber networks remains limited. Here, we report a field demonstration of polarization-controlled reconfigurable four-photon interference over a commercially deployed metropolitan fiber network. Using a fully fiber-coupled linear-optical platform, we observe a fusion-type four-photon interference signature in the presence of real-world impairments, including photon loss, polarization drift, and timing uncertainty. By performing polarization-resolved measurements on two locally retained photons, we conditionally select distinct two-photon coincidence channels that exhibit Bell-like and N00N-like behavior under an idealized source model. Rather than pursuing multi-partite entanglement verification, this work focuses on establishing the technical feasibility of multi-photon interference and reconfigurable conditional state preparation in an operational network environment. These results serve as a systems-level validation milestone toward future multi-photon quantum-networking architectures that require robust interference performance outside the laboratory.

Abstract:
Within the familiar circuit-based quantum computational setting, we introduce and analyze a toy model of a quantum physical device capable of internal, self-referential deliberation. The key idea is to represent ``deliberation'' as a coherent iterative branching process, in which competing branch-dependent system evolutions are maintained in superposition, with additional control and memory registers recording branch histories, and the policy register adaptively biasing subsequent development. We provide explicit quantum circuit realizations and carry out detailed step-by-step derivations of the entangled control--memory--system--policy dynamics. We carefully distinguish between internally adaptive and internally reinforced deliberations, proposing the architectures for both, and briefly discuss categorical and controlled--Stinespring reformulations, as well as their conceptual implications. The primary construction models a memory-driven deliberation where the policy update depends on which actions were taken, not on their results. We also present a simple extension that allows for minimalistic, outcome-driven policy updates, implementing a coherent feedback loop that steers the system toward a target state regardless of initial branch-dependent evolution. This loop can be interpreted as a quantum autopilot or search-and-rescue mechanism, illustrating how a device can autonomously correct and optimize its internal strategy in superposition. Finally, we briefly consider various implementations of a dialogue that may take place between two deliberating machines. Taken together, this frames the proposed model as a plausible setting for exploring how such devices may maintain multiple alternatives in parallel, while performing an internal decision-making process through coherent branching, entanglement, adaptive policy updates, and policy-driven self-modifying unitary dynamics.

Abstract:
Quantum detectors of single photons are an essential component for quantum information processing across computing, communication and networking. Today's quantum detection system, which consists of single photon detectors, timing electronics, control and data processing software, is primarily used for counting the number of single photon detection events. However, it is largely incapable of extracting other rich physical characteristics of the detected photons, such as their wavelengths, polarization states, photon numbers, or temporal waveforms. This work, for the first time, demonstrates a smart quantum detection system, SQuaD, which integrates a field programmable gate array (FPGA) with a neural network model, and is designed to recognize the features of photons and to eliminate detector dark-count. The SQuaD is a fully integrated quantum system with high timing-resolution data acquisition, onboard multi-scale data analysis, intelligent feature recognition and extraction, and feedback-driven system control. Our \name experimentally demonstrates 1) reliable photon counting on par with the state-of-the art commercial systems; 2) high-throughput data processing for each individual detection events; 3) efficient dark count recognition and elimination; 4) up to 100\% accurate feature recognition of photon wavelength and polarization. Additionally, we deploy the SQuaD to an atomic (erbium ion) photon emitter source to realize noise-free control and readout of a spin qubit in the telecom band, enabling critical advances in quantum networks and distributed quantum information processing.

Abstract:
Reliable single photon detection is the foundation for practical quantum communication and networking. However, today's superconducting nanowire single photon detector(SNSPD) inherently fails to distinguish between genuine photon events and dark counts, leading to degraded fidelity in long-distance quantum communication. In this work, we introduce PhotonIDs, a machine learning-powered photon identification system that is the first end-to-end solution for real-time discrimination between photons and dark count based on full SNSPD readout signal waveform analysis. PhotonIDs ~demonstrates: 1) an FPGA-based high-speed data acquisition platform that selectively captures the full waveform of signal only while filtering out the background data in real time; 2) an efficient signal preprocessing pipeline, and a novel pseudo-position metric that is derived from the physical temporal-spatial features of each detected event; 3) a hybrid machine learning model with near 98% accuracy achieved on photon/dark count classification. Additionally, proposed PhotonIDs ~ is evaluated on the dark count elimination performance with two real-world case studies: (1) 20 km quantum link, and (2) Erbium ion-based photon emission system. Our result demonstrates that PhotonIDs ~could improve more than 31.2 times of signal-noise-ratio~(SNR) on dark count elimination. PhotonIDs ~ marks a step forward in noise-resilient quantum communication infrastructure.

Abstract:
We give an algorithm that converts any tensor network (TN) into a sequence of local unitaries whose composition block-encodes the network contraction, suitable for Quantum Eigenvalue / Singular Value Transformation (QET/QSVT). The construction embeds each TN as a local isometry and dilates it to a unitary. Performing this step for every site of the tensor, allows the full network to be block-encoded. The theory is agnostic to virtual-bond sizes; for qubit resource counts and examples we assume global power-of-two padding. Further, we present a deterministic sweep that maps Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) / Ising Hamiltonians into Matrix Product Operators (MPOs) and general TN. We provide formal statements, pseudo-code, resource formulae, and a discussion of the use for state preparation and learning of general quantum operators.

Abstract:
In this work, we investigate the velocity effects on information degradation due to the Unruh effect in accelerated quantum systems (with finite interaction time). We consider a detector moving along a spatial trajectory within a two-dimensional plane. The quantum systems studied were: accelerated single-qubit, quantum interferometric circuit, and which-path distinguishability circuit. Thus, for non-relativistic velocity regime, we obtained analytical expressions such as transition rates, quantum coherence, visibility, distinguishability, and the complementarity relation. On the other hand, for the ultra-relativistic velocity regime, we saw that the Unruh effect is suppressed and therefore the detector does not respond in this case. Our findings revealed that velocity effects imply mitigation of information degradation, this interesting behaviors happen because of the composite effect of both velocity and acceleration. The results obtained show that the addition of the non-relativistic, transverse and constant motion of an accelerated detector can play a protective role in quantumness in systems at high accelerations, although the effects are very small.

Abstract:
In the $k$-mismatch problem, given a pattern and a text of length $n$ and $m$ respectively, we have to find if the text has a sub-string with a Hamming distance of at most $k$ from the pattern. This has been studied in the classical setting since 1982 and recently in the quantum computational setting by Jin and Nogler and Kociumaka, Nogler, and Wellnitz. We provide a simple quantum algorithm that solves the problem in an approximate manner, given a parameter $ε\in (0, 1]$. It returns an occurrence as a match only if it is a $\left(1+ε\right)k$-mismatch. If it does not return any occurrence, then there is no $k$-mismatch. This algorithm has a time (size) complexity of $\tilde{O}\left( ε^{-1} \sqrt{\frac{mn}{k}} \right)$.

Abstract:
We pose and solve the problem of quantum filtering based on continuous-in-time quadrature measurements (homodyning) for the case where the quantum process is in a thermal state. The standard construction of quantum filters involves the determination of the conditional expectation onto the von Neumann algebra generated by the measured observables with the non-demolition principle telling us to restrict the domain (the observables to be estimated) to the commutant of the algebra. The finite-temperature case, however, has additional structure: we use the Araki-Woods representation for the measured quadratures, but the Tomita-Takesaki theory tells us that there exists a separate, commuting representation and therefore the commutant will have a richer structure than encountered in the Fock vacuum case. We apply this to the question of quantum trajectories to the Davies-Fulling-Unruh model. Here, the two representations are interpreted as the fields in the right and left Rindler wedges.

Abstract:
Bivariate bicycle codes are promising candidates for high-threshold, low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum memories. Meanwhile, color codes are the most prominent self-dual CSS codes, supporting transversal Clifford gates that have been demonstrated experimentally. In this work, we combine these advantages and introduce a broad family of self-dual bivariate bicycle codes. These codes achieve higher encoding rates than surface and color codes while admitting transversal CNOT, Hadamard, and $S$ gates. In particular, we enumerate weight-8 self-dual bivariate bicycle codes with up to $n \leq 200$ physical qubits, realized on twisted tori that enhance code distance and improve stabilizer locality. Representative examples include codes with parameters $[[n,k,d]]$: $[[16,4,4]]$, $[[40,6,6]]$, $[[56,6,8]]$, $[[64,8,8]]$, $[[120,8,12]]$, $[[152,6,16]]$, and $[[160,8,16]]$.

Abstract:
Quantum state transfer is a fundamental requirement for scalable quantum computation, where fast and reliable communication between distant subsystems is essential. In this work, we present a protocol for quantum state transfer in linear Ising chains. Starting from a perfect state transfer scheme via a Heisenberg Hamiltonian with inhomogeneous couplings, we adapt it for architectures implementing the transverse-field Ising model by encoding the information in domain walls. The resulting linear Ising chain makes quantum transport experiments accessible to many platforms for analog quantum simulation. We test the protocol for 1-, 2-, and 3- spin states, obtaining high transfer fidelities of up to 0.99 and study the accuracy dependence on the domain wall approximation. These results are the first step in paving the way for an experimental implementation of the protocol.

Abstract:
The state hidden subgroup problem (StateHSP) is a recent generalization of the hidden subgroup problem. We present an algorithm that solves the non-abelian StateHSP over $N$ copies of the dihedral group of order $8$ (the symmetries of a square). This algorithm is of interest for learning non-Pauli stabilizers, as well as related symmetries relevant for the problem of Hamiltonian spectroscopy. Our algorithm is polynomial in the number of samples and computational time, and requires only constant depth circuits. This result extends previous work on the abelian StateHSP and, as a special case, provides a solution for the ordinary hidden subgroup problem on this specific non-abelian group.

Abstract:
Qubit-efficient optimization studies how large combinatorial problems can be addressed with quantum circuits whose width is far smaller than the number of logical variables. In quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), objective values depend only on one- and two-body statistics, yet standard variational algorithms explore exponentially large Hilbert spaces. We recast qubit-efficient optimization as a geometric question: what is the minimal representation the objective itself requires?   Focusing on QUBO problems, we show that enforcing mutual consistency among pairwise statistics defines a convex body -- the level-2 Sherali-Adams polytope -- that captures the information on which quadratic objectives depend. We operationalize this geometry in a minimal variational pipeline that separates representation, consistency, and decoding: a logarithmic-width circuit produces pairwise moments, a differentiable information projection enforces local feasibility, and a maximum-entropy ensemble provides a principled global decoder.   This information-minimal construction achieves near-optimal approximation ratios on large unweighted Max-Cut instances (up to N=2000) at shallow depth, indicating that pairwise polyhedral geometry already captures the relevant structure in this regime. By making the information-minimal geometry explicit, this work establishes a clean baseline for qubit-efficient optimization and sharpens the question of where genuinely quantum structure becomes necessary.

Abstract:
Quantum walks, the quantum analogue to the classical random walk, have been shown to model fluid dynamics. Neutral atom hardware is a promising choice of platform for implementing quantum walks due to its ability to implement native multiqubit ($\geq\!3$-qubit) gates and to dynamically re-arrange qubits. Using error modelling for multiqubit Rydberg gates via two-photon adiabatic rapid passage, we present the gate sequences and predicted final state fidelities for some toy quantum walks, including `lazy' quantum walks. These `lazy' quantum walks include a rest state and therefore provide an integral step towards quantum walks for fluid simulation.

Berry monopoles always cancel when summing over a complete set of energy eigenstates. We demonstrate that analogous sum rules exist for geometric phases and their underlying 2-forms in non-adiabatic evolution. Our result has implications for qudit computation as it limits the types of gates that can be implemented by purely geometric means.

Abstract:
Photon detection is a cornerstone of quantum technology, traditionally regarded as a static device-level operation constrained by the intrinsic physical properties of single-photon detectors (SPDs). Consequently, high-performance detection has been heavily reliant on superconducting technologies, whose requirement for cryogenic temperatures imposes significant infrastructure burdens and limits scalable deployment. To circumvent these constraints, we propose the Enhanced Single-Photon Detection (ESPD) framework, which shifts the photon-detection paradigm from device-centric optimization to an integrated quantum-information-processing (QIP) task. By incorporating state preparation, controlled operations, projective measurements, and multi-copy decision analysis, we establish a nonlinear dynamical model that reformulates detection as an iteratively enhanced process. This architecture enables systematic performance upgrades through structural design rather than material modification, allowing high-performance detection with exclusively room-temperature hardware. Through analytical approximations, Monte Carlo analysis, and numerical simulations, we show that the ESPD dynamics converge to a high-performance basin of attraction even when initialized by low-performance SPDs. While physical realization requires further component integration efforts, this work establishes a rigorous theoretical foundation for enhancing detection via architectural QIP principles. It provides not only a blueprint for next-generation room-temperature photon detection but also a general methodology for transcending device-level constraints in broader quantum technologies.

Abstract:
Utility-scale solid-state quantum devices will need to fabricate quantum devices at scale using imperfect processes. By introducing tolerance to fabrication defects into the design of the quantum devices, we can improve the yield of usable quantum chips and lower the cost of useful systems. Automated Compilation Including Dropouts (ACID) is a framework that works in the ancilla-free (or `middle-out') paradigm, to generate syndrome extraction circuits for general stabiliser codes in the presence of defective couplers or qubits. In the ancilla-free paradigm, we do not designate particular qubits as measurement ancillas, instead measuring stabilisers using any of the data qubits in their support. This approach leads to a great deal of flexibility in how syndrome extraction circuits can be implemented. ACID works by constructing and solving an optimisation problem within the ancilla-free paradigm to find a short syndrome extraction circuit. Applied to the surface code, ACID produces syndrome-extraction circuits of depth between $1\times$ (no overhead) and $1.5\times$ relative to the depth of defect-free circuits. The LUCI algorithm, the best prior art, yielded a $2 \times$ overhead, so ACID offers a significant time saving. The yield of surface code chips with a logical error rate at most $10\times$ the dropout-free baseline is up to $3\times$ higher using ACID than using LUCI. I demonstrate the broad applicability of ACID by compiling syndrome extraction circuits for bivariate bicycle codes and the colour code. For these circuits, we incur a circuit-depth overhead of between $1\times$ (no overhead) and $2.5\times$ relative to defect-free circuits. I believe this work is the first to simulate both of these families of codes in the presence of fabrication defects.

Abstract:
We introduce a symmetry-adapted framework for simulating quantum dynamics based on Pauli propagation. When a quantum circuit possesses a symmetry, many Pauli strings evolve redundantly under actions of the symmetry group. We exploit this by merging Pauli strings related through symmetry transformations. This procedure, formalized as the symmetry-merging Pauli propagation algorithm, propagates only a minimal set of orbit representatives. Analytically, we show that symmetry merging reduces space complexity by a factor set by orbit sizes, with explicit gains for translation and permutation symmetries. Numerical benchmarks of all-to-all Heisenberg dynamics confirm improved stability, particularly under truncation and noise. Our results establish a group-theoretic framework for enhancing Pauli propagation, supported by open-source code demonstrating its practical relevance for classical quantum-dynamics simulations.

Abstract:
Fault-tolerant quantum computers use decoders to monitor for errors and find a plausible correction. A decoder may provide a decoder confidence score (DCS) to gauge its success. We adopt a swim distance DCS, computed from the shortest path between syndrome clusters. By contracting tensor networks, we compare its performance to the well-known complementary gap and find that both reliably estimate the logical error probability (LEP) in a decoding window. We explore ways to use this to mitigate the LEP in entire circuits. For shallow circuits, we just abort if any decoding window produces an exceptionally low DCS: for a distance-13 surface code, rejecting a mere 0.1% of possible DCS values improves the entire circuit's LEP by more than 5 orders of magnitude. For larger algorithms comprising up to trillions of windows, DCS-based rejection remains effective for enhancing observable estimation. Moreover, one can use DCS to assign each circuit's output a unique LEP, and use it as a basis for maximum likelihood inference. This can reduce the effects of noise by an order of magnitude at no quantum cost; methods can be combined for further improvements.

Abstract:
Time-dependent electromagnetic drives are fundamental for controlling complex quantum systems, including superconducting Josephson circuits. In these devices, accurate time-dependent Hamiltonian models are imperative for predicting their dynamics and designing high-fidelity quantum operations. Existing numerical methods, such as black-box quantization (BBQ) and energy-participation ratio (EPR), excel at modeling the static Hamiltonians of Josephson circuits. However, these techniques do not fully capture the behavior of driven circuits stimulated by external microwave drives, nor do they include a generalized approach to account for the inevitable noise and dissipation that enter through microwave ports. Here, we introduce novel numerical techniques that leverage classical microwave simulations that can be efficiently executed in finite element solvers, to obtain the time-dependent Hamiltonian of a microwave-driven superconducting circuit with arbitrary geometries. Importantly, our techniques do not rely on a lumped-element description of the superconducting circuit, in contrast to previous approaches to tackling this problem. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach by characterizing the driven properties of realistic circuit devices in complex electromagnetic environments, including coherent dynamics due to charge and flux modulation, as well as drive-induced relaxation and dephasing. Our techniques offer a powerful toolbox for optimizing circuit designs and advancing practical applications in superconducting quantum computing.

Abstract:
Electrons bound to shallow donors in ZnSe quantum wells are promising candidates for optically addressable spin qubits and single-photon sources. However, their optical coherence and indistinguishability are often limited by spectral broadening arising from charge fluctuations in the local environment. Here, we report electrical control of single donor qubits in ZnSe quantum wells. The applied field induces a DC Stark shift that tunes the emission energy over a range exceeding 30 times the inhomogeneous linewidth, effectively compensating for emitter-to-emitter variations. Concurrently, the field stabilizes trap occupancy, yielding a twofold reduction in optical linewidth and the suppression of spectral wandering. A statistical model based on trap dynamics qualitatively reproduces these observations and elucidates the mechanism of field-assisted charge noise suppression. Our results identify electrical control as a versatile pathway to significantly improve optical and spin addressability.

Abstract:
Wavefunction collapse is commonly associated with unavoidable physical disturbance of the measured system. Here we show that in driven-dissipative quantum systems, continuous measurement can induce strong trajectory-level collapse while leaving the ensemble-averaged steady state strictly invariant. We identify measurement-invariant steady states whose unconditional density matrix remains unchanged under continuous monitoring, despite pronounced measurement-induced localization in conditioned quantum trajectories. This separation between trajectory-level collapse and ensemble invariance defines a regime of partial collapse, in which measurement-induced localization is continuously counteracted by dissipative dynamics. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for steady-state invariance under continuous measurement and identify Liouvillian symmetry as a concrete dynamical mechanism enforcing it. Our results clarify the distinction between conditional collapse and physical disturbance in open quantum systems and provide a framework for non-invasive continuous monitoring in driven-dissipative settings.

Abstract:
A theoretical analysis of the Casimir interaction between an arc and plate is conducted, which remains unexplored despite its relevance to Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) fabrication. The configuration consists of a rigid finite plate and a flexible curved nanomembrane, with radius 100 micrometers, initially concave toward the rigid plate. The maximum thickness is evaluated for which the nanomembrane undergoes a change in curvature: from concave to convex with respect to the plate, due to the Casimir interaction. The Casimir energy for a curved surface is derived using the Proximity Force Approximation (PFA) with next-to-leading-order (NTLO) corrections. Kirchhoff-Love theory for a thin isotropic plate of constant thickness is used to estimate the bending energy. Material-dependent effects on the Casimir interaction are evaluated by comparing Au and Ag plates. The maximum thickness is derived where U_Casimir > U_bending for distances in the range of 0.1-1 micrometers. Results show curvature reversal occurs for nanomembranes with nanoscale thicknesses at the studied distances. Silver nanomembranes tolerate greater thickness than gold nanomembranes due to material-dependent properties. Comparison between NTLO-corrected PFA and perturbative PFA confirms the accuracy of the NTLO approach. The Casimir arc-to-plate geometry in MEMS enables Casimir-based actuation, enhances devices reliability, and prevents stiction. These findings provide thickness constraints for MEMS design and performance, accounting for the Casimir force.

Abstract:
Entanglement distillation and entanglement cost are fundamental tasks in quantum entanglement theory. This work studies both in the probabilistic setting and focuses on the asymptotic error exponent of probabilistic entanglement distillation when the operational model is $δ$-approximately nonentangling or $δ$-approximately dually nonentangling quantum instruments. While recent progress has clarified limitations of probabilistic transformations in general resource theories, an analytic formula for the error exponent of probabilistic entanglement distillation under approximately (dually) nonentangling operations has remained unavailable. Building on the framework of postselected quantum hypothesis testing, we establish a direct connection between probabilistic distillation and postselected hypothesis testing against the set of separable states. In particular, we derive an analytical characterization of the distillation error exponent under $δ$-approximately nonentangling quantum instruments. Besides, we relate the exponent to postselected hypothesis testing with measurements restricted to be separable. We further investigate probabilistic entanglement dilution and establish a relation between probabilistic entanglement costs under approximately nonentangling and approximately dually nonentangling instruments, together with a bound on the probabilistic entanglement cost under nonentangling instruments.

Abstract:
Scalable distributed quantum computing (DQC) has motivated the design of multiple quantum data-center (QDC) architectures that overcome the limitations of single quantum processors through modular interconnection. While these architectures adopt fundamentally different design philosophies, their relative performance under realistic quantum hardware constraints remains poorly understood.   In this paper, we present a systematic benchmarking study of four representative QDC architectures-QFly, BCube, Clos, and Fat-Tree-quantifying their impact on distributed quantum circuit execution latency, resource contention, and scalability. Focusing on quantum-specific effects absent from classical data-center evaluations, we analyze how optical-loss-induced Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair generation delays, coherence-limited entanglement retry windows, and contention from teleportation-based non-local gates shape end-to-end execution performance. Across diverse circuit workloads, we evaluate how architectural properties such as path diversity and path length, and shared BSM (Bell State Measurement) resources interact with optical-switch insertion loss and reconfiguration delay. Our results show that distributed quantum performance is jointly shaped by topology, scheduling policies, and physical-layer parameters, and that these factors interact in nontrivial ways. Together, these insights provide quantitative guidance for the design of scalable and high-performance quantum data-center architectures for DQC.

Abstract:
Quantum computers are inherently noisy, and a crucial challenge for achieving large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computing is to implement quantum error correction. A promising direction that has made rapid recent progress is to design hardware that has a specific noise profile, leading to a significantly higher threshold for noise with certain quantum error correcting codes. This Perspective focuses on erasure qubits, which enable hardware-efficient quantum error correction, by concatenating an inner code built-in to the hardware with an outer code. We focus on implementations of dual-rail encoded erasure qubits using superconducting qubits, giving an overview of recent developments in theory and simulation, and hardware demonstrators. We also discuss the differences between implementations; near-term applications using quantum error detection; and the open problems for developing this approach towards early fault-tolerant quantum computers.

Abstract:
We show that Weyl's abandoned idea of local scale invariance has a natural realization at the quantum level in pilot-wave (deBroglie-Bohm) theory. We obtain the Weyl covariant derivative by complexifying the electromagnetic gauge coupling parameter. The resultant non-hermiticity has a natural interpretation in terms of local scale invariance in pilot-wave theory. The conserved current density is modified from $|ψ|^2$ to the local scale invariant, trajectory-dependent ratio $|ψ|^2/ \mathbf{1}^2[\mathcal{C}]$, where $\mathbf 1[\mathcal C]$ is a scale factor that depends on the pilot-wave trajectory $\mathcal C$ in configuration space. Our approach is general, and we implement it for the Schrödinger, Pauli, and Dirac equations coupled to an external electromagnetic field. We also implement it in quantum field theory for the case of a quantized axion field interacting with a quantized electromagnetic field. We discuss the equilibrium probability density and show that the corresponding trajectories are unique.

Abstract:
We prove that learning an unknown quantum channel with input dimension $d_A$, output dimension $d_B$, and Choi rank $r$ to diamond distance $\varepsilon$ requires $ Ω\!\left( \frac{d_A d_B r}{\varepsilon \log(d_B r / \varepsilon)} \right)$ channel queries when $d_A\leq rd_B/2$ or $d_A=rd_B$. This improves the best previous $Ω(d_A d_B r)$ bound by introducing explicit $\varepsilon$-dependence. We show that this scaling is optimal, up to logarithmic farctors, when $d_A=rd_B$. The proof constructs an ensemble of channels that are well separated in diamond norm yet admit Stinespring isometries that are close in operator norm.

Abstract:
We show that the Schur complement of the nodal admittance matrix, which reduces a multiport electromagnetic environment to the driving-point admittance $Y_{\mathrm{in}}(s)$ at the Josephson junction, naturally leads to an eigenvalue-dependent boundary condition determining the dressed mode spectrum. This identification provides a four-step quantization procedure: (i) compute or measure $Y_{\mathrm{in}}(s)$, (ii) solve the boundary condition $sY_{\mathrm{in}}(s) + 1/L_J = 0$ for dressed frequencies, (iii) synthesize an equivalent passive network, (iv) quantize with the full cosine nonlinearity retained. Within passive lumped-element circuit theory, we prove that junction participation decays as $O(ω_n^{-1})$ at high frequencies when the junction port has finite shunt capacitance, ensuring ultraviolet convergence of perturbative sums without imposed cutoffs. The standard circuit QED parameters, coupling strength $g$, anharmonicity $α$, and dispersive shift $χ$, emerge as controlled limits with explicit validity conditions.

Abstract:
A quantum system that interacts with an environment generally undergoes nonunitary evolution described by a non-Markovian or Markovian master equation. In this paper, we construct the non-Markovian Redfield master equation for a quantum scalar field that interacts with a second field through a bilinear or nonlinear interaction on a Minkowski background. We use the resulting master equation to set up coupled differential equations that can be solved to obtain the equal-time two-point function of the system field. We show how the equations simplify under various approximations including the Markovian limit and argue that the Redfield equation-based solution provides a perturbative resummation to the standard second-order Dyson series result. For the bilinear interaction, we explicitly show that the Redfield solution is closer to the exact solution compared to the perturbation theory-based one. Further, the environment correlation function is oscillatory and nondecaying in this case, making the Markovian master equation a poor approximation. For the nonlinear interaction, on the other hand, the environment correlation function is sharply peaked and the Redfield solution matches that obtained using a Markovian master equation in the late-time limit.

Abstract:
The broad band resonant spin echo interferometer, CANISIUS, is presented. CANISIUS is built in a versatile way, such that it can be operated in both a continuous broad band beam or a pulsed Time of Flight beam. This versatility also extends to the modes available to the instrument, such as Neutron Resonant Spin Echo, Spin Echo (Modulated) Small Angle Neutron Scattering and coherent averaging to produce structured wavefunctions for scattering. The instrument may also be used as an interferometer, to probe fundamental questions in quantum mechanics. In this paper we detail both the continuous and Time of Flight options of the instruments. In addition we demonstrate the applicability of our interferometer to ultra small angle scattering in a white beam. Finally we demonstrate a new spin echo interferometry tool, which uses incomplete recombination of the two path states to generate composite wavefunctions with special structure. In particular we show that this method produces neutron wavefunctions that exist in a superposition of two quantum mechanical OAM modes, l =+1 or -1 We illustrate that just as this method can be used to generate certain structured waves, it may also be used to characterize the structure of the input wavefunction.

Abstract:
The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) is a quantum phenomenon in which a two-dimensional system exhibits a quantized Hall resistance $h/e^2$ in the absence of magnetic field, where $h$ is the Planck constant and $e$ is the electron charge. In this work, we extend this novel phase to three dimensions and thus propose a three-dimensional QAHE exhibiting richer and more versatile transport behaviors. We first confirm this three-dimensional QAHE through the quantized Chern number, then establish its bulk-boundary correspondence, and finally reaffirm it via the distinctive transport properties. Remarkably, we find that the three-dimensional QAHE hosts two chiral surface states along one spatial direction while a pair of chiral hinge states along another direction, and the location of the hinge states depends sensitively on the Fermi energy. These two types of boundary states are further connected through a perpendicular chiral surface states, whose chirality is also Fermi energy dependent. Consequently, depending on the transport direction, its Hall resistance can quantize to $0$, $h/e^2$, or $\pm h/e^2$ when the Fermi energy is tuned across the charge neutral point. This three-dimensional QAHE not only fill the gap in the Hall effect family but also holds significant potentials in device applications such as in-memory computing.

Abstract:
Quantum computing is viewed as a promising technology because of its potential for polynomial growth in complexity, in contrast to the exponential growth observed in its classical counterparts. In the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), a hybrid variational algorithm, is utilized to simulate molecules using qubits and calculate molecular properties. However, simulating a chemical reaction to compute the reaction energy using VQE algorithm has not yet reached chemical accuracy relative to the benchmark computational chemistry methods due to limitations such as the number of qubits, circuit depth, and noise introduced within the model. To address this issue, we propose the definition of different active spaces for studying chemical reactions, incorporating irreducible representations of both the ground and excited states of the molecules. Our results demonstrate that this approach achieves chemical accuracy in predicting the reaction energy for various reactions. For all reactions studied, the difference in reaction energies between conventional computational chemistry methods and the quantum-classical hybrid VQE algorithm is less than 1 kcal/mol. Furthermore, our analysis simplifies the process of selecting active spaces and electrons for each reaction, reducing it to a single optimal combination that ensures the chemical accuracy for each reaction.

Abstract:
Frustration-free Hamiltonians provide pivotal models for understanding quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we establish a general framework for frustration-free fermionic systems. First, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for a free fermion model to be frustration-free. In the case of translation-invariant, noninteracting systems, we show that any band touching between the valence and conduction bands is at least quadratic. Furthermore, by extending the Gosset-Huang inequality to fermionic systems, we demonstrate that even in interacting and non-translation-invariant cases, the finite-size gap of gapless excitations scales as $O((\log L)^2/L^2)$, provided the ground-state correlation function exhibits a power-law decay. Our results provide a foundation for studying frustration-free fermionic systems, including flat-band ferromagnetism and $η$-pairing states.

Abstract:
We develop a general theory of frustration-free free-fermion systems and derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for such Hamiltonians. Assuming locality and translation invariance, we find that any band touching between the valence and the conduction bands is always quadratic or softer, which rules out the possibility of describing Dirac and Weyl semimetals using frustration-free local Hamiltonians. We further construct a frustration-free free-fermion model on the honeycomb lattice and show that its density fluctuations acquire an anomalous gap originating from the diverging quantum metric associated with the quadratic band-touching points. Nevertheless, an $O(1/L^2)$ finite-size scaling of the charge-neutral excitation gap can be verified even in the presence of interactions, consistent with the more general results we derive in an accompanying work [arXiv:2503.12879].

Abstract:
In this work, we propose a continuous-variable quantum algorithm to compute the projection coefficients of a holomorphic function in the Segal--Bargmann space by leveraging its isometric correspondence with single-mode quantum states. Using CV quantum circuits, we prepare the state $\ket{f}$ associated with $f(z)$ and extract the coefficients $c_n = \braket{n}{f}$ via photon-number-resolved detection, enhanced by interferometric phase referencing to recover full complex amplitudes. This enables direct quantum estimation and visualization of the coefficient sequence -- offering a scalable, measurement-based alternative to classical numerical integration for functional analysis and non-Gaussian state characterization.

Abstract:
The development of large-scale, programmable photonic circuits capable of performing generic matrix-vector multiplication is essential for both classical and quantum information processing. However, this goal is hindered by high losses, hardware errors, and difficulties in programmability. We propose an enhanced architecture for programmable photonic circuits that minimizes circuit depth and offers analytical programmability, properties that have not been simultaneously achieved in previous circuit designs. Our proposal exploits a previously overlooked representation of general nonunitary matrices as sums of two unitaries. Furthermore, similar to the traditional singular value decomposition-based circuits, the circuits in our unitary-sum-based architecture inherit the advantages of the constituent unitary circuits. Overall, our proposal provides a significantly improved solution for matrix-vector multiplication compared to the established approaches.

Abstract:
We investigate low-frequency noise in a spin-qubit device made in isotopically purified Si/Si-Ge. Observing sizable cross-correlations among energy fluctuations of different qubits, we conclude that these fluctuations are dominated by charge noise. At low frequencies, the noise spectra are not well described by a power law; instead, they reveal the presence of a few individual two-level fluctuators (TLFs). We demonstrate that the noise cross-correlations allow one to get information on the spatial location of such individual TLFs.

Abstract:
We introduce a framework for resolving electron-hole dynamics within wavefunction-based multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree-Fock (MCTDHF) theory. Central to this framework is a time-domain generalization of the extended Koopmans' theorem, which rigorously defines time-dependent hole states through single-electron removal. From this foundation, we prove the existence of exact equations of motion for time-dependent Dyson orbitals, enabling instantaneous construction of photofragments' reduced density matrices. The formalism further yields a systematic procedure to extract hole-resolved observables, such as channel-resolved photoelectron momentum distributions, directly from time-dependent \textit{ab initio} wavefunctions. As a demonstration, we employ an attosecond $ω-2ω$ laser strategy to control hole dynamics, thereby resolving a long-standing challenge in MCTDHF simulations. This advance opens a pathway for exploring correlated multielectron dynamics in atoms and molecules under ultrafast laser fields.

Abstract:
We analyze the zero energy collision of three identical bosons in the same internal state with total orbital angular momentum $L=2$, assuming short range interactions. By solving the Schrödinger equation asymptotically, we derive two expansions of the wave function when three bosons are far apart or a pair of bosons and the third boson are far apart. The scattering hypervolume $D$ is defined for this collision. Unlike the scattering hypervolume defined by one of us in 2008, whose dimension is length to the fourth power, the dimension of $D$ studied in the present paper is length to the eighth power. We then derive the expression of $D$ when the interaction potentials are weak, using the Born's expansion. We also calculate the energy shift of such three bosons with three different momenta $\hbar \mathbf{k_{1}}$, $\hbar\mathbf{k_{2}}$ and $\hbar\mathbf{k_{3}}$ in a large periodic box. The obtained energy shift depends on $D^{(0)}/Ω^{2}$ and $D/Ω^{2}$, where $D^{(0)}$ is the three-body scattering hypervolume defined for the three-body $L=0$ collision and $Ω$ is the volume of the periodic box. We also calculate the contribution of $D$ to the three-body T-matrix element for low-energy collisions. We then calculate the shift of the energy and the three-body recombination rate due to $D^{(0)}$ and $D$ in the dilute homogeneous Bose gas. The contribution to the three-body recombination rate constant from $D$ is proportional to $T^2$ if the temperature $T$ is much larger than the quantum degeneracy temperature but still much lower than the temperature scale at which the thermal de Broglie wave length becomes comparable to the physical range of interaction.

Abstract:
Cold atom systems in optical lattices have long been recognized as an ideal platform for bridging condense matter physics and quantum optics. Here, we investigate the 1D fermionic superradiance in an optical lattice, and observe novel tricritical phenomena and multistability in finite-temperature cases. As a starting point, which can be analytically calculated, we compare the 1D and 2D Fermi gases in zero-temperature limit. It turns out that the tricritical point originates from the higher-order Fermi surface nesting (FSN), and the infrared divergence in 1D systems is absent in 2D cases. When extending to finite-temperature cases, our numerical results reveal that both quantum- and classical-type trcritical phenomena can be observed simultaneously. Moreover, there exists an optimal temperature for observing superradiance. This work provides a new approach to understanding the relation between quantum and classical phase transitions.

Abstract:
Motivated by the recent Ge hole spin qubit experiments, we construct and study a two-leg spin ladder from a quantum dot array with spin-orbit couplings (SOCs), aiming to uncover the many-body phase diagrams and provide concrete guidance for the Ge hole spin qubit experiments. The spin ladder is described by an unprecedented, complex spin Hamiltonian, which contains antiferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM), and anisotropic exchange interactions. We analyze the spin ladder Hamiltonian in two complementary situations, the strong rung coupling limit and the weak rung coupling limit. In the strong rung coupling limit, we systematically construct effective spin-1/2 chain models, connecting the well-studied one-dimensional spin models and providing a recipe for Hamiltonian engineering. It is worth emphasizing that effective DM interactions can be completely turned off while the microscopic DM interactions are generically inevitable. Moreover, the staggered DM interactions, which are not possible in the microscopic spin model, can also be realized in the effective spin-1/2 model. In the weak rung coupling limit, we employ Abelian bosonization and Luther-Emery fermionization, uncovering a multitude of phases. Several commensurate-incommensurate transitions are driven by both the longitudinal magnetic field and the DM interactions in the legs (chains). Remarkably, the low-energy phase diagrams show strong dependence in the DM interaction, providing a concrete way to identify the strength of SOC in the experiments. Our work bridges quantum many-body theory and spin qubit device physics, establishing spin ladders made of spin-orbit-coupled quantum dots as a promising platform for engineering exotic spin models, constructing quantum many-body states, and enabling programmable quantum computations.

Abstract:
Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) are a class of non-equilibrium phase transitions that occur in many-body quantum systems during real-time evolution, rather than through parameter tuning as in conventional phase transitions. This paper presents an exact analytical approach to studying DQPTs by combining complex dynamics with the real-space renormalization group (RG). RG transformations are interpreted as iterated maps on the complex plane, establishing a connection between DQPTs and the Julia set, the boundary separating the basins of attraction of the stable fixed points. This framework is applied to a quantum quench in the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model, where we examine the sensitivity of DQPTs to variations in boundary conditions. We show that altering the topology of the spin chain can suppress DQPTs and provide a qualitative explanation based on quantum speed limits.

Abstract:
We present experimental techniques that employ an optical accordion lattice with dynamically tunable spacing to create and study bright matter-wave solitons in optical lattices. The system allows precise control of lattice parameters over a wide range of lattice spacings and depths. We detail calibration methods for the lattice parameters that are adjusted to the varying lattice spacing, and we demonstrate site-resolved atom number preparation via microwave addressing. Lattice solitons are generated through rapid quenches of the atomic interaction strength and the external trapping potential. We systematically optimize the quench parameters, such as duration and final scattering length, to maximize soliton stability. Our results provide insight into nonlinear matter-wave dynamics in discretized systems and establish a versatile platform for the controlled study of lattice solitons.

Abstract:
Time-frequency representations stemmed in 1932 with the introduction of the Wigner distribution. For most of the 20th century, research in this area primarily focused on defining joint probability distributions for position and momentum in quantum mechanics. Applications to electrical engineering were soon established with the seminal works of Gabor and the researchers at Bell Labs. In 2012, Bai, Li and Cheng used for the first time metaplectic operators, defined in the middle of 20th century by Van Hove, to generalize the Wigner distribution and unify effectively the most used time-frequency representations under a common framework. This work serves as a comprehensive up-to-date survey on time-frequency representations defined by means of metaplectic operators, with particular emphasis on the recent contributions by Cordero and Rodino, who exploited metaplectic operators to their limits to generalize the Wigner distributions. Their idea provides a fruitful framework where properties of time-frequency representations can be explained naturally by the structure of the symplectic group.

Abstract:
We investigate the short-interval expansion of the subsystem fidelity in two-dimensional conformal field theories (2D CFTs) using the operator product expansion (OPE) of twist operators. We obtain universal contributions from general quasiprimary operators valid for arbitrary 2D CFTs, along with specific results in free massless boson and fermion theories. The analytical predictions demonstrate excellent agreement with established analytical results in field theories and numerical calculations in integrable models. Furthermore, we extend the method to holographic CFTs, where subsystem fidelity serves to analyze the distinguishability of black hole microstates through the AdS/CFT correspondence. This work establishes a unified framework for quantifying quantum state distinguishability across various 2D CFTs, bridging quantum information techniques with applications in quantum gravity.

Abstract:
We introduce the Constraint-Enhanced Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (CE-QAOA), a shallow, constraint-aware ansatz that operates inside the one-hot product space [n]^m, where m is the number of blocks and each block is initialized in an n-qubit W_n state. We give an ancilla-free, depth-optimal encoder that prepares W_n using n-1 two-qubit rotations per block, and a two-local block-XY mixer that preserves the one-hot manifold and has a constant spectral gap on the one-excitation sector. At the level of expressivity, we establish per-block controllability, implying approximate universality per block. At the level of distributional behavior, we show that, after natural block and symbol permutation twirls, shallow CE-QAOA realizes an encoded unitary 1-design and supports approximate second-moment (2-design) behavior; combined with a Paley-Zygmund argument, this yields finite-shot anticoncentration guarantees.   Algorithmically, we wrap constant-depth sampling with a deterministic feasibility checker to obtain a polynomial-time hybrid quantum-classical solver (PHQC) that returns the best observed feasible solution in O(S n^2) time, where S is a polynomial shot budget. We obtain two advantages. First, when CE-QAOA fixes r >= 1 locations different from the start city, we achieve a Theta(n^r) reduction in shot complexity even against a classical sampler that draws uniformly from the feasible set. Second, against a classical baseline restricted to raw bitstring sampling, we show an exp(Theta(n^2)) minimax separation. In noiseless circuit simulations of traveling salesman problem instances with n in {4,...,10} locations from the QOPTLib benchmark library, we recover the global optimum at depth p = 1 using polynomial shot budgets and coarse parameter grids defined by the problem size.

Abstract:
We argue that a simple qubit-regularized $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ lattice gauge theory on a plaquette chain serves as a pseudo-one-dimensional toy model for Yang-Mills theory in three spatial dimensions. We map the chain Hamiltonian to the Transverse Field Ising Model in a uniform magnetic field and demonstrate that it can be tuned to a continuum limit in which the short-distance physics is governed by the asymptotically free Ising conformal field theory describing free Majorana fermions, while the long-distance regime contains massive excitations of the $E_8$ quantum field theory that can be interpreted as one-dimensional analogues of glueballs. Furthermore, we find $\sqrtσ/m_1 = 0.249(1)$ where $σ$ is the string tension between two static quarks and $m_1$ is the mass of the lightest glueball.

Abstract:
We investigate quantum entanglement and coherence for four classes of Bell-like fermionic states in the vicinity of the event horizon of a Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GHS) dilaton black hole. Contrary to the common expectation that maximally entangled states always provide superior quantum resources, our results show that their entanglement can be lower than that of suitably chosen non-maximally entangled states in this curved spacetime background. This reveals that non-maximally entangled states may offer operational advantages for entanglement-based tasks under gravitational effects. In contrast, quantum coherence exhibits monotonic behavior: larger initial coherence leads to systematically enhanced robustness against the dilaton induced degradation. These results indicate that the optimal choice of initial quantum states depends sensitively on the specific quantum resource, either quantum entanglement or quantum coherence, required for quantum information processing near a dilaton black hole.

Abstract:
This paper argues that the traditional opposition between determinism and indeterminism in physics is representational rather than ontological. Deterministic-stochastic dualities are available in principle, and arise in a non-contrived way in many scientifically important models. When dynamical systems admit mathematically equivalent deterministic and stochastic formulations, their observable predictions depend only on the induced structure of correlations between preparations and measurement outcomes. I use this model-equivalence to motivate a model-invariance criterion for ontological commitment, according to which only structural features that remain stable across empirically equivalent representations, and whose physical effects are invariant under such reformulations, are candidates for realism. This yields a fallibilist form of structural realism grounded in modal robustness rather than in the specifics of any given mathematical representation. Features such as conservation laws, symmetries, and causal or metric structure satisfy this criterion and can be encoded in observable relations in mathematically intelligible ways. By contrast, the localisation of modal selection -- whether in initial conditions, stochastic outcomes, or informational collapse mechanisms -- is not invariant under empirically equivalent reformulations and is therefore best understood as a gauge choice rather than an ontological feature. The resulting framework explains how certain long-standing problems in the foundations of physics, including the measurement problem and the perceived conflict between physical determinism and free agency, arise from the reification of representational artefacts. By distinguishing model-invariant structure from modelling conventions, I offer a realist ontology for modern physics that combines empirical openness with resistance to metaphysical overreach.

Abstract:
We investigate the non-Hermitian Kitaev chain with non-reciprocal hopping amplitudes and asymmetric superconducting pairing. We work out the symmetry structure of the model and show that particle-hole symmetry (PHS) is preserved throughout the entire parameter regime. As a consequence of PHS, the topological phase transition point of a finite open chain coincides with that of the periodic (infinite) system. By explicitly constructing the zero-energy wave functions (Majorana modes), we show that Majorana modes necessarily occur as reciprocal localization pairs accumulating on opposite boundaries, whose combined probability density exhibits an exact cancellation of the non-Hermitian skin effect for the zero energy modes. Excited states, by contrast, generically display skin-effect localization, with particle and hole components accumulating at opposite ends of the system. At the level of bulk topology, we further construct a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant in restricted parameter regimes that correctly distinguishes the topological and trivial phases. Finally, we present the topological phase diagram of the non-Hermitian Kitaev chain across a broad range of complex parameters and delineate the associated phase boundaries.

Abstract:
We show that every holographic entropy inequality can be recast in the form: "some entanglement wedges reach deeper in the bulk than some other entanglement wedges." When the inequality is saturated, the two sets of wedges reach equally deep. Because bulk depth geometrizes CFT scales, the inequalities enforce and protect the holographic Renormalization Group.

Abstract:
In this paper, we introduce LOTUS (Layer-Ordered Temporally-Unified Schedules), which is a framework that restructures QAOA from a high-dimensional, chaotic search into a low-dimensional dynamical system. By replacing independent layer-wise angles with a Hybrid Fourier-Autoregressive (HFA) mapping, LOTUS enforces global temporal coherence while maintaining local flexibility. LOTUS consistently outperforms standard optimizers, achieving up to a $27.2\%$ improvement in expectation values over L-BFGS-B and $20.8\%$ compared with COBYLA. Besides, our proposed method drastically reduces computational costs, requiring over $90\%$ fewer iterations than methods like Powell or SLSQP.

Abstract:
Multimodal learning aims to enhance perceptual and decision-making capabilities by integrating information from diverse sources. However, classical deep learning approaches face a critical trade-off between the high accuracy of black-box feature-level fusion and the interpretability of less outstanding decision-level fusion, alongside the challenges of parameter explosion and complexity. This paper discusses the accuracy-interpretablity-complexity dilemma under the quantum computation framework and propose a feature entanglement-based quantum multimodal fusion neural network. The model is composed of three core components: a classical feed-forward module for unimodal processing, an interpretable quantum fusion block, and a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) for deep feature extraction. By leveraging the strong expressive power of quantum, we have reduced the complexity of multimodal fusion and post-processing to linear, and the fusion process also possesses the interpretability of decision-level fusion. The simulation results demonstrate that our model achieves classification accuracy comparable to classical networks with dozens of times of parameters, exhibiting notable stability and performance across multimodal image datasets.

Abstract:
Building reliable quantum computers requires protecting fragile quantum states from inevitable environmental noise and operational errors. While quantum error correction codes like the Steane $[\![7,1,3]\!]$ code provide elegant theoretical solutions, their practical success hinges critically on how we measure errors - a process called syndrome extraction. The challenge lies in the ancilla qubits used for measurement: when they fail, errors can cascade across the entire quantum system, destroying the very information we're trying to protect. We address this fundamental problem by implementing and comparing three sophisticated syndrome measurement strategies: Shor's cat-state approach, which distributes measurements across multiple entangled ancillas achieving 85-92% preparation success; Steane's encoded-ancilla method using complete error-corrected logical qubits reaching 97.8% syndrome fidelity; and a flexible unified framework that adapts strategies based on hardware capabilities. Through extensive simulations using IBM's Qiskit platform spanning randomized benchmarking and T-heavy circuits, we demonstrate that intelligent ancilla management improves error suppression by up to 2.4$\times$ compared to standard approaches. Our implementations achieve logical error rates as low as $5.1 \times 10^{-5}$ under realistic noise conditions with physical error rates of $10^{-3}$, while maintaining near-unity logical fidelity (0.99997) even for deep circuits. The threshold analysis reveals robust performance across distance-3 to distance-13 codes with characteristic threshold curves showing exponential error suppression below the critical physical error rate. These results provide immediately deployable tools for near-term quantum devices and establish practical design principles for scaling toward fault-tolerant quantum computers.

Abstract:
Quantum federated learning (QFL) emerges as a powerful technique that combines quantum computing with federated learning to efficiently process complex data across distributed quantum devices while ensuring data privacy in quantum networks. Despite recent research efforts, existing QFL frameworks struggle to achieve optimal model training performance primarily due to inherent heterogeneity in terms of (i) quantum noise where current quantum devices are subject to varying levels of noise due to varying device quality and susceptibility to quantum decoherence, and (ii) heterogeneous data distributions where data across participating quantum devices are naturally non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID). To address these challenges, we propose a novel integrated sporadic-personalized approach called SPQFL that simultaneously handles quantum noise and data heterogeneity in a single QFL framework. It is featured in two key aspects: (i) for quantum noise heterogeneity, we introduce a notion of sporadic learning to tackle quantum noise heterogeneity across quantum devices, and (ii) for quantum data heterogeneity, we implement personalized learning through model regularization to mitigate overfitting during local training on non-IID quantum data distributions, thereby enhancing the convergence of the global model. Moreover, we conduct a rigorous convergence analysis for the proposed SPQFL framework, with both sporadic and personalized learning considerations. Theoretical findings reveal that the upper bound of the SPQFL algorithm is strongly influenced by both the number of quantum devices and the number of quantum noise measurements. Extensive simulation results in real-world datasets also illustrate that the proposed SPQFL approach yields significant improvements in terms of training performance and convergence stability compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract:
We explore the experimental predictions of the local scale invariant, non-Hermitian pilot-wave (de Broglie-Bohm) formulation of quantum theory introduced in arXiv:2601.03567. We use Weyl's definition of gravitational radius of charge to obtain the fine-structure constant for non-integrable scale effects $α_S$. The minuteness of $α_S$ relative to $α$ ($α_S/α\sim 10^{-21}$) effectively hides the effects in usual quantum experiments. In an Aharonov-Bohm double-slit experiment, the theory predicts that the position probability density depends on which slit the particle trajectory crosses, due to a non-integrable scale induced by the magnetic flux. This experimental prediction can be realistically tested for an electrically neutral, heavy molecule with mass $m \sim 10^{-19} \text{g}$ at a $\sim 10^6 \text{ esu}$ flux regime. We analyse the Weyl-Einstein debate on the second-clock effect using the theory and show that spectral frequencies are history-independent. We thereby resolve Einstein's key objection against local scale invariance, and obtain two further experimental predictions. First, spectral intensities turn out to be history-dependent. Second, energy eigenvalues are modified by tiny imaginary corrections that modify spectral linewidths. We argue that the trajectory dependence of the probabilities renders our theory empirically distinguishable from other quantum formulations that do not use pilot-wave trajectories, or their mathematical equivalents, to derive experimental predictions.

This note bridges the gap between theoretical second quantization and practical quantum hardware by detailing the Jordan-Wigner mapping for the Unitary Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (UCCSD) ansatz. Using the hydrogen molecule in a minimal basis as a case study, we explicitly derive the Pauli strings required for single and double excitations. Additionally, we discuss the translation of these operators into quantum circuits, with a focus on implementation nuances such as the difference between mathematical rotations and physical gates like the $\sqrt{X}$ (SX) gate.

Abstract:
Since its inception, Bohmian mechanics has been surrounded by a halo of controversy. Originally proposed to bypass the limitations imposed by von Neumann's theorem on the impossibility of hidden-variable models in quantum mechanics, it faced strong opposition from the outset. Over time, however, its use in tackling specific problems across various branches of physics has led to a gradual shift in attitude, turning the early resistance into a more moderate acceptance. A plausible explanation for this change may be that, since the late 1990s and early 2000s, Bohmian mechanics has been taking on a more operational and practical role. The original hidden-variable idea has gradually faded from its framework, giving way to a more pragmatic approach that treats it as a suitable analytical and computational tool. This discussion explores how and why such a shift in perspective has occurred and, therefore, answers questions such as whether Bohmian mechanics should be considered once and for all a legitimate quantum representation (i.e., worth being taught in elementary quantum mechanics courses) or, by extension, whether these ideas can be transferred to and benefit other fields. Here, the Schrödinger equation and several specific numerical examples are re-examined in the light of a less restrictive view than the standard one usually adopted in quantum mechanics.

Abstract:
Fault-tolerant quantum computing requires extremely precise knowledge and control of qubit dynamics during the application of a gate. We develop a data-driven learning protocol for characterizing quantum gates that builds off previous work on learning the Nakajima-Mori-Zwanzig (NMZ) formulation of open system dynamics from time series data, which allows detailed reconstruction of quantum evolution, including non-Markovian dynamics. We demonstrate this learning technique on three different systems: a simulation of a qubit whose dynamics are purely Markovian, a simulation of a driven qubit coupled to stochastic noise produced by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, and trapped-ion experimental data of a driven qubit whose noise environment is not characterized ahead of time. Our technique is able to learn the generators of time evolution, or the NMZ operators, in all three cases and can learn the timescale in which the qubit dynamics can no longer be accurately described by a purely Markovian model. Our technique complements existing quantum gate characterization methods such as gate set tomography by explicitly capturing non-Markovianity in the gate generator, thus allowing for more thorough diagnosis of noise sources.

Abstract:
The Universal Operator Growth Hypothesis formulates time evolution of operators through Lanczos coefficients. In practice, however, numerical instability and memory cost limit the number of coefficients that can be computed exactly. In response to these challenges, the standard approach relies on fitting early coefficients to asymptotic forms, but such procedures can miss subleading, history-dependent structures in the coefficients that subsequently affect reconstructed observables. In this work, we treat the Lanczos coefficients as a causal time sequence and introduce a transformer-based model to autoregressively predict future Lanczos coefficients from short prefixes. For both classical and quantum systems, our machine-learning model outperforms asymptotic fits, in both coefficient extrapolation and physical observable reconstruction, by achieving an order-of-magnitude reduction in error. Our model also transfers across system sizes: it can be trained on smaller systems and then be used to extrapolate coefficients on a larger system without retraining. By probing the learned attention patterns and performing targeted attention ablations, we identify which portions of the coefficient history are most influential for accurate forecasts.

Abstract:
Automated theorem proving, or more broadly automated reasoning, aims at using computer programs to automatically prove or disprove mathematical theorems and logical statements. It takes on an essential role across a vast array of applications and the quest for enhanced theorem-proving capabilities remains a prominent pursuit in artificial intelligence. Here, we propose a generic framework for quantum automated theorem proving, where the intrinsic quantum superposition and entanglement features would lead to potential advantages. In particular, we introduce quantum representations of knowledge bases and propose corresponding reasoning algorithms for a variety of tasks. We show how automated reasoning can be achieved with quantum resolution in both propositional and first-order logic with quadratically reduced query complexity. In addition, we propose the quantum algebraic proving method for geometric theorems, extending Wu's algebraic approach beyond the classical setting. Through concrete examples, including geometry problems from the International Mathematical Olympiad, we demonstrate how a quantum computer may prove geometric theorems with quadratic better query complexity. Our results establish a primary approach towards building quantum automatic theorem provers, which would be crucial for practical applications of both near-term and future quantum technologies.

Abstract:
The Schrödinger equation predicts interference when a beamsplitter's trajectory includes a segment where its speed exceeds the phase velocity of a free non-zero rest mass particle that is in a momentum eigenstate. Such interference is neither possible for electromagnetic waves nor for eigenstates of momentum in the non-relativistic limit of the Klein-Gordon equation since the speed of the beamsplitter cannot exceed the phase velocity of the wave. The dual behavior of reflection and transmission in this case is discussed for dielectric and diffracting beamsplitters.

Abstract:
Quantum error correction is one of the fundamental building blocks of digital quantum computation. The Quantum Lego formalism has introduced a systematic way of constructing new stabilizer codes out of basic lego-like building blocks, which in previous work we have used to generate improved error correcting codes via an automated reinforcement learning process. Here, we take this a step further and show the use of a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm. We combine classical reinforcement learning with calls to two commercial quantum devices to search for a stabilizer code to correct errors specific to the device, as well as an induced photon loss error.

Abstract:
Variational quantum circuits have become a widely used tool for performing quantum machine learning (QML) tasks on labeled quantum states. In some specific tasks or for specific variational ansätze, one may perform measurements on a restricted part of the overall input state. This is the case for, e.g., quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs), where after each layer of the circuit a subset of qubits of the processed state is measured or traced out, and at the end of the network one typically measures a local observable. In this work, we demonstrate that measuring observables with restricted support results in larger label prediction variance in regression QML tasks. We show that the reason for this is, essentially, the number of distinct eigenvalues of the observable one measures after the application of a variational circuit.

Abstract:
Understanding the energetic efficiency of quantum computers is essential for assessing their scalability and for determining whether quantum technologies can outperform classical computation beyond runtime alone. In this work, we analyze the energy required to solve the Boson Sampling problem, a paradigmatic task for quantum advantage, using a realistic photonic quantum computing architecture. Using the Metric-Noise-Resource methodology, we establish a quantitative connection between experimental control parameters, dominant noise processes, and energetic resources through a performance metric tailored to Boson Sampling. We estimate the energy cost per sample and identify operating regimes that optimize energetic efficiency. By comparing the energy consumption of quantum and state-of-the-art classical implementations, we demonstrate the existence of a quantum energetic advantage -- defined as a lower energy cost per sample compared to the best-known classical implementation -- that emerges before the onset of computational advantage, even in regimes where classical algorithms remain faster. Finally, we propose an experimentally feasible Boson Sampling architecture, including a complete noise and loss budget, that enables a near-term observation of quantum energetic advantage.

Abstract:
Feedback-based quantum algorithms (FQAs) operate by iteratively growing a quantum circuit to optimize a given task. At each step, feedback from qubit measurements is used to inform the next quantum circuit update. In practice, the sampling cost associated with these measurements can be significant. Here, we ask whether FQA parameter sequences can be predicted using classical machine learning, obviating the need for qubit measurements altogether. To this end, we train a teacher-student model to map a MaxCut problem instance to an associated FQA parameter curve in a single classical inference step. Numerical experiments show that this model can accurately predict FQA parameter curves across a range of problem sizes, including problem sizes not seen during model training. To evaluate performance, we compare the predicted parameter curves in simulation against FQA reference curves and linear quantum annealing schedules. We observe similar results to the former and performance improvements over the latter. These results suggest that machine learning can offer a heuristic, practical path to reducing sampling costs and resource overheads in quantum algorithms.

Abstract:
It is commonly thought that observers in distinct branches of an Everettian multiverse cannot communicate without violating the linearity of quantum theory. Here we show a counterexample, demonstrating that inter-branch communication is in fact possible, entirely within standard quantum theory. We do this by considering a Wigner's-friend scenario, where an observer (Wigner) can have quantum control over another observer (the friend). We present a thought experiment where the friend in superposition can receive a message written by a distinct copy of themselves in the multiverse, with the aid of Wigner. To maintain the unitarity of quantum theory, the observers must have no memory of the message that they sent. Our thought experiment challenges conventional wisdom regarding the ultimate limits of what is possible in an Everettian multiverse. It has a surprising potential application which involves using knowledge-creation paradoxes for testing Everettian quantum theory against single-world theories.

Abstract:
Tensor network states are an indispensable tool for the simulation of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems. In recent years, tree tensor network states (TTNS) have been successfully used for two-dimensional systems and to benchmark quantum simulation approaches for condensed matter, nuclear, and particle physics. In comparison to the more traditional approach based on matrix product states (MPS), the graph distance of physical degrees of freedom can be drastically reduced in TTNS. Surprisingly, it turns out that, for large systems in $D>1$ spatial dimensions, MPS simulations of low-energy states are nevertheless more efficient than TTNS simulations. With a focus on $D=2$ and 3, the scaling of computational costs for different boundary conditions is determined under the assumption that the system obeys an entanglement (log-)area law, implying that bond dimensions scale exponentially in the surface area of the associated subsystems.

Abstract:
We demonstrate a dissipative protocol for ground-state preparation of a quantum spin chain on a trapped-ion quantum computer. As a first step, we derive a Kraus representation of a dissipation channel for the protocol recently proposed by Ding et al. [Phys. Rev. Res. 6, 033147 (2024)] that still holds for arbitrary temporal discretization steps, extending the analysis beyond the Lindblad dynamics regime. The protocol guarantees that the fidelity with the ground state monotonically increases (or remains unchanged) under repeated applications of the channel to an arbitrary initial state, provided that the ground state is the unique steady state of the dissipation channel. Using this framework, we implement dissipative ground-state preparation of a transverse-field Ising chain for up to 19 spins on the trapped-ion quantum computer Reimei provided by Quantinuum. Despite the presence of hardware noise, the dynamics consistently converges to a low-energy state far away from the maximally mixed state even when the corresponding quantum circuits contain as many as 4110 entangling gates, demonstrating the intrinsic robustness of the protocol. By applying zero-noise extrapolation, the resulting energy expectation values are systematically improved to agree with noiseless simulations within statistical uncertainties.

Abstract:
Identifying the state of a quantum bit (qubit), known as quantum state discrimination, is a crucial operation in quantum computing. However, it has been the most error-prone and time-consuming operation on superconducting quantum processors. Due to stringent timing constraints and algorithmic complexity, most qubit state discrimination methods are executed offline. In this work, we present an enhanced real-time quantum state discrimination system leveraging FPGA-based AI Engine technology. A multi-layer neural network has been developed and implemented on the AMD Xilinx VCK190 FPGA platform, enabling accurate in-situ state discrimination and supporting mid-circuit measurement experiments for multiple qubits. Our approach leverages recent advancements in architecture research and design, utilizing specialized AI/ML accelerators to optimize quantum experiments and reduce the use of FPGA resources.

Abstract:
Current quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) protocols guarantee communication security by estimating the error rates of photons in the X and Z bases. This take the reference frame calibration between communicating parties as a necessary prerequisite. However, in mobile communications scenarios, achieving continuous and accurate reference frame calibration poses significant challenges. To address this issue, this paper proposes a reference-frame-independent (RFI) QSDC protocol. This protocol only requires ensuring the calibration accuracy of one direction of the reference frame, while allowing a misalignment angle $β$ in the other two directions. To improve the protocol's robustness against reference frame fluctuations, we introduce a $β$-independent parameter C into the security analysis framework and rederive the protocol's security bounds. Additionally, we construct a system model and optimize the pulse intensity of the signal states, enabling the protocol to achieve optimal performance under each level of channel attenuation. At an attenuation of 10 dB (corresponding to a communication distance of 25 km), the secrecy message capacities for $β= 0^{ \circ} $ and $45^{ \circ} $ are $8.765 \times10^{-6}$ bit/pulse and $4.150 \times10^{-6}$ bit/pulse, respectively. Compared with the single-photon-based QSDC, the communication distance of the protocol proposed in this paper is significantly extended. When $β= 0^{ \circ} $ and $45^{ \circ} $, the maximum transmission distances of the RFI QSDC protocol are 27.875 km and 26.750 km, which is about 155.9 % and 149.7 % of that of the single-photon-based QSDC protocol.

Abstract:
The exploration of photonic systems for quantum information processing has generated widespread interest in multiple cutting-edge research fields. Photonic frequency encoding stands out as an especially viable approach, given its natural alignment with established optical communication technologies, including fiber networks and wavelength-division multiplexing systems. Substantial reductions in hardware resources and improvements in quantum performance can be expected by utilizing multiple frequency modes. The integration of nonlinear photonics with microresonators provides a compelling way for generating frequency-correlated photon pairs across discrete spectral modes. Here, by leveraging the high material nonlinearity and low nonlinear loss, we demonstrate an efficient chip-scale multi-wavelength quantum light source based on AlGaAs-on-insulator, featuring a free spectral range of approximately 200 GHz at telecom wavelengths. The optimized submicron waveguide geometry provides both high effective nonlinearity (~550 m$^{-1}$W$^{-1}$) and broad generation bandwidth, producing eleven distinct wavelength pairs across a 35.2 nm bandwidth with an average spectral brightness of 2.64 GHz mW$^{-2}$nm$^{-1}$. The generation of energy-time entanglement for each pair of frequency modes is verified through Franson interferometry, yielding an average net visibility of 93.1%. With its exceptional optical gain and lasing capabilities, the AlGaAs-on-insulator platform developed here shows outstanding potential for realizing fully integrated, ready-to-deploy quantum photonic systems on chip.

Abstract:
Bell or Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) tests on superconducting quantum processors are commonly interpreted under the assumption that repeated circuit executions sample a single, stationary preparation ensemble. Here we show that this assumption can be violated on contemporary hardware, with direct implications for the interpretation of observed Bell violations. We introduce an ensemble-divergence framework in which slow temporal drift of the preparation process induces context-dependent effective ensembles, even when measurement independence and locality are preserved. This leads to a relaxed Bell bound $|S| \le 2 + 6δ_{\mathrm{ens}}$, where $δ_{\mathrm{ens}}$ quantifies preparation nonstationarity. Because $δ_{\mathrm{ens}}$ is not directly observable, we develop an operational witness $δ_{\mathrm{op}}$ based on bin-resolved outcome statistics for fixed measurement channels. Using Pauli-axis measurements on IBM superconducting processors, we observe statistically significant operational drift that persists after full two-qubit readout mitigation, ruling out measurement artifacts. In contrast, drift extracted from CHSH-optimal measurements is eliminated by mitigation, demonstrating that such settings are unsuitable for diagnosing preparation nonstationarity. We further show that the observed Bell violations imply only modest ensemble divergences, comparable in scale to those required in Hall-type measurement-dependence models, but arising here solely from preparation drift combined with experimental scheduling. Our results identify a preparation-dependent loophole relevant to Bell tests on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices and highlight the necessity of drift-aware protocols for reliable quantum certification.

Abstract:
Dynamical decoupling (DD) and bath engineering are two parallel techniques employed to mitigate qubit decoherence resulting from their unavoidable coupling to the environment. Here, we present a hybrid DD approach that integrates pulsed DD with bath spin polarization to enhance qubit coherence within the central spin model. This model, which can be realized using GaAs semiconductor quantum dots or analogous quantum simulators, demonstrates a significant extension of the central spin's coherence time by approximately 2 to 3 orders of magnitude that compared with the free-induced decay time, where the dominant contribution from DD and a moderate improvement from spin-bath polarization. This study, which integrates uniaxial dynamical decoupling and auxiliary bath-spin engineering, paves the way for prolonging coherence times in various practical quantum systems, including GaAs/AlGaAs, silicon and Si/SiGe. And this advancement holds substantial promise for applications in quantum information processing.

Abstract:
The limit between the two regimes of spontaneous-parametric down-conversion (SPDC) or four-wave-mixing (FWM) regarding the pump intensity has been theoretically investigated using a semi-classical model and analytical calculations. A unitless quantity has been defined, corresponding to the photon-pairs flux per frequency unit: it has been found equal to 0.369 at this limit. The ratio between the magnitudes of the electric fields of the generated photons and of vacuum has been also calculated, equal to 1.718, and the pump intensity has been plotted as a function of the interaction length for different values of the second-order electric susceptibility in the case of SPDC and of the third-order electric susceptibility for FWM. These quantitative results confirm that below the limit, the nonlinear process can be truly considered as spontaneous, i.e. mainly seeded by the quantum fluctuations of vacuum, while the generated photons mainly govern the pump photon splitting above the limit, which corresponds more to an optical parametric amplification / difference frequency generation regime. Knowing quantitatively the limit between the two regimes thanks to the present calculations will be a useful guide for further quantum calculations and measurements from either side of the limit in order to catch the full quantum picture of SPDC and FWM from low to high pump intensities.

Abstract:
We verify transverse spatial entanglement of photon-pairs generated in spontaneous parametric down conversion using a nonlinear interferometric technique without relying on any coincidence detection. We experimentally demonstrate the violation of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen criterion and of the Mancini-Giovannetti-Vitali-Tombesi criterion using single photon interference of one of the photons of the pairs. We also provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis. The experimental results that we have obtained show good agreement with the theoretical values. Our method performs well under experimental losses and can be applied to highly non-degenerate sources, where there are no suitable detectors for one of the photons in the quantum state and our method could also be extended to the discrete degrees of freedom to certify high-dimensional (OAM) entanglement.

Abstract:
In quantum software engineering (QSE), quantum software testing (QST) has attracted increasing attention as quantum software systems grow in scale and complexity. Since QST evaluates quantum programs through execution under designed test inputs, empirical studies are widely used to assess the effectiveness of testing approaches. However, the design and reporting of empirical studies in QST remain highly diverse, and a shared methodological understanding has yet to emerge, making it difficult to interpret results and compare findings across studies. This paper presents a methodological analysis of empirical studies in QST through a systematic examination of 59 primary studies identified from a literature pool of size 384. We organize our analysis around ten research questions that cover key methodological dimensions of QST empirical studies, including objects under test, baseline comparison, testing setup, experimental configuration, and tool and artifact support. Through cross-study analysis along these dimensions, we characterize current empirical practices in QST, identify recurring limitations and inconsistencies, and highlight open methodological challenges. Based on our findings, we derive insights and recommendations to inform the design, execution, and reporting of future empirical studies in QST.

Abstract:
Photonic systems offer a promising platform for interconnecting quantum processors and enabling scalable, networked architectures. Designing and verifying such architectures requires a unified formalism that integrates linear algebraic reasoning with probabilistic and control-flow structures. In this work, we introduce a graphical framework for distributed quantum computing that brings together linear optics, the ZX-calculus, and dataflow programming. Our language supports the formal analysis and optimization of distributed protocols involving both qubits and photonic modes, with explicit interfaces for classical control and feedforward, all expressed within a synchronous dataflow model with discrete-time dynamics. Within this setting, we classify entangling photonic fusion measurements, show how their induced Pauli errors can be corrected via a novel flow structure for fusion networks, and establish correctness proofs for new repeat-until-success protocols enabling arbitrary fusions. Layer by layer, we construct qubit architectures incorporating practical optical components such as beam splitters, switches, and photon sources, with graphical proofs that they are deterministic and support universal quantum computation. Together, these results establish a foundation for verifiable compilation and automated optimization in networked quantum computing.

Abstract:
We present a semi-device-independent quantum random number generator (QRNG) based on the violation of a contextuality inequality, implemented by the integration of two silicon photonic chips. Our system combines a heralded single-photon source with a reconfigurable interferometric mesh to implement qutrit state preparation, transformations, and measurements suitable for testing a KCBS contextuality inequality. This architecture enables the generation of random numbers from the intrinsic randomness of single-photon interference in a complex optical network, while simultaneously allowing a quantitative certification of their security without requiring entanglement. We observe a contextuality violation exceeding the classical bound by more than 10σ, unambiguously confirming non-classical behavior. From this violation, we certify a conditional min-entropy per experimental round of Hmin = 0.077 +- 0.002, derived via a tailored semidefinite-programming-based security analysis. Each measurement outcome therefore contains at least 0.077 +- 0.002 bits of extractable genuine randomness, corresponding to an asymptotic generation rate of 21.7 +- 0.5 bits/s. These results establish a viable route towards general-purpose, untrusted quantum random number generators compatible with practical integrated photonic quantum networks.

Abstract:
Practical QKD modulators introduce correlations between consecutively emitted pulses due to bandwidth limitations, violating key assumptions underlying many security proof techniques. Here, we address this problem by introducing a simple yet powerful mathematical framework to directly extend phase-error-estimation-based security proofs for imperfect but uncorrelated sources to also incorporate encoding correlations. Our framework overcomes important limitations of previous approaches in terms of generality and rigor, significantly narrowing the gap between theoretical security guarantees and real-world QKD implementations.

Abstract:
Scalable trapped-ion quantum computing requires fast and reliable transport of ions through complex, segmented radiofrequency trap architectures without inducing excessive motional excitation. We present a numerical toolchain for the systematic generation of time-dependent electrode voltages enabling fast, low-excitation ion shuttling in segmented radiofrequency traps. Based on a model of the trap electrode geometry, the framework combines an electrostatic field solver, efficient unconstrained optimization, waveform postprocessing, and dynamical simulations of ion motion to compute voltage waveforms that realize prescribed transport trajectories while respecting experimental constraints such as voltage limits and bandwidth. The toolchain supports arbitrary trap geometries, including junctions and multi-zone layouts, and allows for the flexible incorporation of optimization objectives. We provide a detailed assessment of the accuracy of the framework by investigating its numerical stability and by comparing measured and predicted secular frequencies. The framework is optimized for numerical performance, enabling rapid numerical prototyping of trap architectures of increasing complexity. As application examples, we apply the framework to the transport of a potential well along a linear, uniformly segmented trap, and we compute a solution for shuttling a potential well around the corner of an X-type trap junction. The presented approach provides an extensible and highly efficient numerical foundation for designing and validating transport protocols in current and next-generation trapped-ion processors.

Abstract:
Neutral atom Quantum Processing Units (QPUs) are emerging as a popular quantum computing technology due to their large qubit counts and flexible connectivity. However, performance challenges arise as large circuits experience significant fidelity drops, while small circuits underutilize hardware and face initialization latency issues. To tackle these problems, we propose $\textit{multi-programming on neutral atom QPUs}$, allowing the co-execution of multiple circuits by logically partitioning the qubit array. This approach increases resource utilization and mitigates initialization latency while maintaining result fidelity. Currently, state-of-the-art compilers for neutral atom architectures do not support multi-programming.   To fill this gap, we introduce MultiQ, the first system designed for this purpose. MultiQ addresses three main challenges: (i) it compiles circuits into a $\textit{virtual zone layout}$ to optimize spatio-temporal hardware utilization; (ii) it parallelizes the execution of co-located circuits, allowing single hardware instructions to operate on different circuits; and (iii) it includes an algorithm to verify the functional independence of the bundled circuits. MultiQ functions as a cross-layer system comprising a compiler, controller, and checker. Our compiler generates \emph{virtual zone layouts} to enhance performance, while the controller efficiently maps these layouts onto the hardware and resolves any conflicts. The checker ensures the correct bundling of circuits.   Experimental results show a throughput increase from 3.8$\times$ to 12.3$\times$ when multi-programming 4 to 14 circuits, with fidelity largely maintained, ranging from a 1.3% improvement for four circuits to only a 3.5% loss for fourteen circuits. Overall, MultiQ facilitates concurrent execution of multiple quantum circuits, boosting throughput and hardware utilization.

Abstract:
We present systematic and resource-efficient constructions of continuous symmetry projectors, particularly $U(1)$ particle number and $SU(2)$ total spin, tailored for fault-tolerant quantum computations. Our approach employs a linear combination of unitaries (LCU) as well as generalized quantum signal processing (GQSP and GQSVT) to implement projectors. These projectors can then be coherently applied as state filters prior to quantum phase estimation (QPE). We analyze their asymptotic gate complexities for explicit circuit realizations. For the particle number and $S_z$ symmetries, GQSP offers favorable resource usage features owing to its low ancilla qubit requirements and robustness to finite precision rotation gate synthesis. For the total spin projection, the structured decomposition of $\hat{P}_{S,M_S}$ reduces the projector T gate count. Numerical simulations show that symmetry filtering substantially increases the QPE success probability, leading to a lower overall cost compared to that of unfiltered approaches across representative molecular systems. Resource estimates further indicate that the cost of symmetry filtering is $3$ to $4$ orders of magnitude lower than that of the subsequent phase estimation step This advantage is especially relevant in large, strongly correlated systems, such as FeMoco, a standard strongly correlated open-shell benchmark. For FeMoco, the QPE cost is estimated at ${\sim}10^{10}$ T gates, while our symmetry projector requires only ${\sim}10^{6}$--$10^{7}$ T gates. These results establish continuous-symmetry projectors as practical and scalable tools for state preparation in quantum chemistry and provide a pathway toward realizing more efficient fault-tolerant quantum simulations.

Using this framework, we obtain asymptotically good CSS codes that fault-tolerantly realize the logical transversal Clifford group. Furthermore, investigating CSS-T codes, we: (a) demonstrate asymptotically good CSS-T codes wherein the transversal $T$ realizes the logical transversal $S^{\dagger}$; (b) show that the condition $C_2 \ast C_1 \subseteq C_1^{\perp}$ is necessary but not sufficient for CSS-T codes; and (c) revise the characterizations of CSS-T codes wherein the transversal $T$ implements the logical identity and the logical transversal $T$, respectively.

Abstract:
This whitepaper surveys the current landscape and short- to mid-term prospects for quantum-enabled optimization and machine learning use cases in industrial settings. Grounded in the QCHALLenge program, it synthesizes hardware trajectories from different quantum architectures and providers, and assesses their maturity and potential for real-world use cases under a standardized traffic-light evaluation framework. We provide a concise summary of relevant hardware roadmaps, distinguishing superconducting and ion-trap technologies, their current states, modalities, and projected scaling trajectories. The core of the presented work are the use case evaluations in the domains of optimization problems and machine learning applications. For the conducted experiments, we apply a consistent set of evaluation criteria (model formulation, scalability, solution quality, runtime, and transferability) which are assessed in a shared system of three categories, ranging from optimistic (solutions produced by quantum computers are competitive with classical methods and/or a clear path to a quantum advantage is shown) to pessimistic (significant hurdles prevent practical application of quantum solutions now and potentially in the future). The resulting verdicts illuminate where quantum approaches currently offer promise, where hybrid classical-quantum strategies are most viable, and where classical methods are expected to remain superior.

Abstract:
Although the principle of superposition lies at the heart of quantum mechanics and is the root of almost all quantum phenomena such as coherence and entanglement, its quantification, except for that related to the resource theory of coherence and interference, remains relatively less studied. In this work, we address quantification of superposition from an information-theoretic perspective. We introduce a family of quantifiers of superposition, the phase-sensitive superposition, by taking into account the phases of amplitudes in the superposition of a fixed basis states (e.g., computational basis states). We establish a conservation relation for the phase-sensitive superposition, which is a kind of complementary relation and is reminiscent of wave-particle duality. We evaluate explicitly the second moment of phase-sensitive superposition and show that it is intrinsically related to the $l^2$-norm coherence. We characterize the dephasing channel induced by the maximally superposed states. We investigate the minimum and maximum superpositions, reveal their basic properties, and illustrate them through various examples. We further explore the dynamics of superposition in the Grover search algorithm, and demonstrate a complementary relation between superposition and success probability of the search algorithm. These results and quantifiers offer tools for analyzing structural features and implications of quantum superposition.

Abstract:
Entanglement swapping is a key primitive for distributing entanglement across nodes in quantum networks. In standard protocols, the outcome of the intermediate measurement determines the resulting state, making the process inherently probabilistic and requiring postselection. In this work, we fully characterize those measurements under which entanglement swapping becomes deterministic: for arbitrary pure inputs, every measurement outcome produces local-unitarily equivalent states. We also show that an optimal measurement, maximizing a concurrence-type entanglement measure, is built from complex Hadamard matrices. For this optimal protocol, we provide a complete, dimension-dependent classification of deterministic entanglement-swapping measurements: unique in dimensions $d=2,3$, infinite for $d=4$, and comprising $72$ inequivalent classes for $d=5$. We further consider a general network with multiple swapping nodes and show that, for $d=2,3$ the resulting end-to-end state is independent of the order in which the repeaters perform the optimal measurements. Our results establish optimal entanglement-swapping schemes that are post-selection free, in the sense that they distribute entanglement across generic quantum network architectures without unfavorable measurement outcomes.

Abstract:
This paper investigates symmetric composite binary quantum hypothesis testing (QHT), where the goal is to determine which of two uncertainty sets contains an unknown quantum state. While asymptotic error exponents for this problem are well-studied, the finite-sample regime remains poorly understood. We bridge this gap by characterizing the sample complexity -- the minimum number of state copies required to achieve a target error level. Specifically, we derive lower bounds that generalize the sample complexity of simple QHT and introduce new upper bounds for various uncertainty sets, including of both finite and infinite cardinalities. Notably, our upper and lower bounds match up to universal constants, providing a tight characterization of the sample complexity. Finally, we extend our analysis to the differentially private setting, establishing the sample complexity for privacy-preserving composite QHT.

Abstract:
We study an open quantum spin chain with non-reciprocal dissipation using a theoretical approach known as time-dependent generalized Gibbs ensemble. In the regime of weak dissipation the system is fully characterized by its rapidity distribution and we derive a closed set of coupled differential equations governing their time evolution. We check the accuracy of this theory by benchmarking the results against numerical simulations. Using this framework we are able to compute both the magnetization density and current dynamics, identifying some relations between the two. The problem of the anomalous power-law exponents identified in a previous work is discussed. Our work constitutes a theoretical approach that is able to describe the physics of non-reciprocal open quantum spin chains beyond analyses based on non-interacting fermions.

Abstract:
For a given quantum state used in sensing, the quantum Cramér-Rao bound (QCRB) sets a fundamental limit on the precision achievable by an unbiased estimator of an unknown parameter, determined by the inverse of the quantum Fisher information (QFI). The QFI serves as an upper bound on the classical Fisher information (CFI), representing the maximum extractable information about the unknown parameter from measurements on a physical system. Thus, a central goal in quantum parameter estimation is to find a measurement, described by a POVM, that saturates the QFI (achieves maximum CFI), and thereby achieves the QCRB. In the idealization that one uses pure states and unitary encodings for sensing, discontinuities can appear in the CFI but not the QFI. In this article, we demonstrate that these discontinuities are important features, quantifying how much Fisher information is lost in the presence of noise. We refer to this as the Fisher information "fragility". We present a simple framework for understanding how discontinuities increase fragility through Jensen's inequality, and demonstrate how one can use this framework to design more robust POVMs for quantum advantage in metrology.

Abstract:
While quantum annealing (QA) has been developed for combinatorial optimization, practical QA devices operate at finite temperature and under noise, and their outputs can be regarded as stochastic samples close to a Gibbs--Boltzmann distribution. In this study, we propose a QA-in-the-loop kernel learning framework that integrates QA not merely as a substitute for Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling but as a component that directly determines the learned kernel for regression. Based on Bochner's theorem, a shift-invariant kernel is represented as an expectation over a spectral distribution, and random Fourier features (RFF) approximate the kernel by sampling frequencies. We model the spectral distribution with a (multi-layer) restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), generate discrete RBM samples using QA, and map them to continuous frequencies via a Gaussian--Bernoulli transformation. Using the resulting RFF, we construct a data-adaptive kernel and perform Nadaraya--Watson (NW) regression. Because the RFF approximation based on $\cos(\bmω^{\top}Δ\bm{x})$ can yield small negative values and cancellation across neighbors, the Nadaraya--Watson denominator $\sum_j k_{ij}$ may become close to zero. We therefore employ nonnegative squared-kernel weights $w_{ij}=k(\bm{x}_i,\bm{x}_j)^2$, which also enhances the contrast of kernel weights. The kernel parameters are trained by minimizing the leave-one-out NW mean squared error, and we additionally evaluate local linear regression with the same squared-kernel weights at inference. Experiments on multiple benchmark regression datasets demonstrate a decrease in training loss, accompanied by structural changes in the kernel matrix, and show that the learned kernel tends to improve $R^2$ and RMSE over the baseline Gaussian-kernel NW. Increasing the number of random features at inference further enhances accuracy.

Abstract:
As quantum devices continue to improve in scale and precision, a central challenge is how to effectively utilize noisy hardware for meaningful computation. Most existing approaches aim to recover noiseless circuit outputs from noisy ones through error mitigation or correction. Here, we show that noisy quantum devices can be directly leveraged as computational resources to enhance the classical simulation of quantum circuits. We introduce the Noisy-device-enhanced Classical Simulation (NDE-CS) protocol, which improves stabilizer-based classical Monte Carlo simulation methods by incorporating data obtained from noisy quantum hardware. Specifically, NDE-CS uses noisy executions of a target circuit together with noisy Clifford circuits to learn how the target circuit can be expressed in terms of Clifford circuits under realistic noise. The same learned relation can then be reused in the noiseless Clifford limit, enabling accurate estimation of ideal expectation values with substantially reduced sampling cost. Numerical simulations on Trotterized Ising circuits demonstrate that NDE-CS achieves orders-of-magnitude reductions in sampling cost compared to the underlying purely classical Monte Carlo approaches from which it is derived, while maintaining the same accuracy. We also compare NDE-CS with Sparse Pauli Dynamics (SPD), a powerful classical framework capable of simulating quantum circuits at previously inaccessible scales, and provide an example where the cost of SPD scales exponentially with system size, while NDE-CS scales much more favorably. These results establish NDE-CS as a scalable hybrid simulation approach for quantum circuits, where noise can be harnessed as a computational asset.

Abstract:
Bosonic codes constitute a promising route to fault-tolerant quantum computing. {Existing Floquet protocols enable analytical construction of bosonic codes but typically rely on slow adiabatic ramps with thousands of driving periods.} In this work, we circumvent this bottleneck by introducing an analytical and deterministic Floquet method that directly synthesizes arbitrary unitaries within a single period. The phase-space unitary ensembles generated by our approach reproduce the Haar-random statistics, enabling practical pseudorandom unitaries in continuous-variable systems. We prepare various prototypical bosonic codes from vacuum and implement single-qubit logical gates with high fidelities using quantum lattice gates. By harnessing the full intrinsic nonlinearity of Josephson junctions, quantum lattice gates decompose quantum circuits into primitive operations for efficient continuous-variable quantum computing.

Abstract:
Bell measurements (BMs) are ubiquitous in quantum information and technology. They are basic elements for quantum commmunication, computation, and error correction. In particular, when performed on logical qubits encoded in physical photonic qubits, they allow for a read-out of stabilizer syndrome information to enhance loss tolerance in qubit-state transmission and fusion. However, even in an ideal setting without photon loss, BMs cannot be done perfectly based on the simplest experimental toolbox of linear optics. Here we demonstrate that any logical BM on stabilizer codes can always be mapped onto a single physical BM perfomed on any qubit pair from the two codes. As a necessary condition for the success of a logical BM, this provides a general upper bound on its success probability, especially ruling out the possibility that the stabilizer information obtainable from only partially succeeding, physical linear-optics BMs could be combined into the full logical stabilizer information. We formulate sufficient criteria to find schemes for which a single successful BM on the physical level will always allow to obtain the full logical information by suitably adapting the subsequent physical measurements. Our approach based on stabilizer group theory is generally applicable to any stabilizer code, which we demonstrate for quantum parity, five-qubit, standard and rotated planar surface, tree, and seven-qubit Steane codes. Our schemes attain the general upper bound for all these codes, while this bound had previously only been reached for the quantum parity code.

Abstract:
Classical low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are a widely deployed and well-established technology, forming the backbone of modern communication and storage systems. It is well known that, in this classical setting, increasing the girth of the Tanner graph while maintaining regular degree distributions leads simultaneously to good belief-propagation (BP) decoding performance and large minimum distance. In the quantum setting, however, this principle does not directly apply because quantum LDPC codes must satisfy additional orthogonality constraints between their parity-check matrices. When one enforces both orthogonality and regularity in a straightforward manner, the girth is typically reduced and the minimum distance becomes structurally upper bounded.   In this work, we overcome this limitation by using permutation matrices with controlled commutativity and by restricting the orthogonality constraints to only the necessary parts of the construction, while preserving regular check-matrix structures. This design breaks the conventional trade-off between orthogonality, regularity, girth, and minimum distance, allowing us to construct quantum LDPC codes with large girth and without the usual distance upper bounds. As a concrete demonstration, we construct a girth-8, (3,12)-regular $[[9216,4612, \leq 48]]$ quantum LDPC code and show that, under BP decoding combined with a low-complexity post-processing algorithm, it achieves a frame error rate as low as $10^{-8}$ on the depolarizing channel with error probability $4 \%$.

Abstract:
For a (possibly partial) Boolean function $f\colon\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}$ as well as a query complexity measure $M$ which maps Boolean functions to real numbers, define the composition limit of $M$ on $f$ by $M^*(f)=\lim_{k\to\infty} M(f^k)^{1/k}$.   We study the composition limits of general measures in query complexity. We show this limit converges under reasonable assumptions about the measure. We then give a surprising result regarding the composition limit of randomized query complexity: we show $R_0^*(f)=\max\{R^*(f),C^*(f)\}$. Among other things, this implies that any bounded-error randomized algorithm for recursive 3-majority can be turned into a zero-error randomized algorithm for the same task. Our result extends also to quantum algorithms: on recursively composed functions, a bounded-error quantum algorithm can be converted into a quantum algorithm that finds a certificate with high probability.   Along the way, we prove various combinatorial properties of measures and composition limits.

Abstract:
Discrete charge fluctuations, routinely observed in semiconductor quantum dot devices, may contribute significantly to device drift and errors resulting from qubit miscalibration. Understanding the nature and origins of these discrete charge fluctuations may provide insights into material improvements or means of mitigating charge noise in semiconductor quantum dot devices. In this work, we measure multi-level charge fluctuations present in a Si/SiGe double quantum dot device over a range of device operating voltages and temperatures. To characterize the parameter-dependent dynamics of the underlying fluctuating degrees of freedom, we perform a detailed analysis of the measured noise timeseries. We perform algorithmically assisted drift detection and change point detection to detrend the data and remove a slow fluctuator component, as a preprocessing step. We perform model comparison on the post-processed time series between different $n$-level fluctuator ($n$LF) factorial hidden Markov models (FHMMs), finding that although at most sweep values the independent pair of 2LFs model would be preferred, in a particular region of voltage space the 4LF model outperforms the other models, indicating a conditional rate dependence between the two fluctuators. By tracking fluctuator transition rates, biases, and weights over a range of different device configurations, we estimate gate voltage and conductivity sensitivity. In particular, we fit a phenomenological, detailed balance model to the extracted independent 2LFs rate data, yielding lever arm estimates in the range of $-2 μ$eV/mV up to $4 μ$eV/mV between the two 2LFs and nearby gate electrodes. We expect that these characterization results may aid in subsequent spatial triangulation of the charge fluctuators.

Abstract:
Emerging theoretical frameworks suggest that physical properties of matter can be altered within an optical cavity by harnessing quantum vacuum electromagnetic fluctuations, even in the total absence of external driving fields. Among the most intriguing predictions is the potential to noninvasively manipulate superconductivity. Here, we experimentally observe modified superconductivity in niobium nitride (NbN) thin films within high-quality-factor ($Q$) terahertz cavities. Using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy, we characterize the NbN response both in free space and within a high-$Q$ photonic-crystal cavity. Our analysis reveals significant cavity-induced modifications to the optical conductivity. A theoretical model indicates that these changes originate from a substantial ($\sim13\,\%$) reduction in the superfluid density and a minor ($\sim2\,\%$) reduction in the superconducting gap, driven by cavity vacuum fluctuations. These results demonstrate a platform for engineering ground states via vacuum--matter coupling, opening frontiers in cavity materials science.

Abstract:
We study the spectral statistics and wave-function properties of a one-dimensional quantum system subject to a Cantor-type fractal potential. By analyzing the nearest-neighbor level spacings, inverse participation ratio (IPR), and the scaling behavior of the integrated density of states (IDS), we demonstrate how the self-similar geometry of the potential is imprinted on the quantum spectrum. The energy-resolved level spacings form a hierarchical, filamentary structure, in sharp contrast to those of periodic and random systems. The normalized level-spacing distribution exhibits a bimodal structure, reflecting the deterministic recurrence of spectral gaps. A multifractal analysis of eigenstates reveals critical behavior: the generalized fractal dimensions $D_q$ lie strictly between the limits of extended and localized states, exhibiting a distinct $q$-dependence. Consistently, the IPR indicates the coexistence of quasi-extended and localized features, characteristic of critical wave functions. The IDS shows anomalous power-law scaling at low energies, with an exponent close to the Hausdorff dimension of the underlying Cantor set, indicating that the geometric fractality governs the spectral dimensionality. At higher energies, this scaling crosses over to the semiclassical Weyl law. Our results establish a direct connection between deterministic fractal geometry, hierarchical spectral statistics, and quantum criticality.

Abstract:
The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) posits how isolated quantum many-body systems thermalize, assuming that individual eigenstates at the same energy density have identical expectation values of local observables in the limit of large systems. While the ETH apparently holds across a wide range of interacting quantum systems, in this work we show that it requires generalization in the presence of thermal first-order phase transitions. We introduce a class of all-to-all spin models, featuring first-order thermal phase transitions that stem from two distinct mean-field solutions (two ``branches'') that exchange dominance in the many-body density of states as the energy is varied. We argue that for energies in the vicinity of the thermal phase transition, eigenstate expectation values do not need to converge to the same thermal value. The system has a regime with coexistence of two classes of eigenstates corresponding to the two branches with distinct expectation values at the same energy density, and another regime with Schrodinger-cat-like eigenstates that are inter-branch superpositions; these two regimes are separated by an eigenstate phase transition. We support our results by semiclassical calculations and an exact diagonalization study of a microscopic spin model, and argue that the structure of eigenstates in the vicinity of thermal first-order phase transitions can be experimentally probed via non-equilibrium dynamics.

Abstract:
We construct 2+1-dimensional lattice models of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases with non-invertible symmetries and investigate their properties using tensor networks. These models, which we refer to as generalized cluster models, are constructed by gauging a subgroup symmetry $H \subset G$ in models with a finite group 0-form symmetry $G$. By construction, these models have a non-invertible symmetry described by the group-theoretical fusion 2-category $\mathcal{C}(G; H)$. After identifying the tensor network representations of the symmetry operators, we study the symmetry acting on the interface between two generalized cluster states. In particular, we will see that the symmetry at the interface is described by a multifusion category known as the strip 2-algebra. By studying possible interface modes allowed by this symmetry, we show that the interface between generalized cluster states in different SPT phases must be degenerate. This result generalizes the ordinary bulk-boundary correspondence. Furthermore, we construct parameterized families of generalized cluster states and study the topological charge pumping phenomena, known as the generalized Thouless pump. We exemplify our construction with several concrete cases, and compare them with known phases, such as SPT phases with $2\mathrm{Rep}((\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{[1]}\times\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{[1]})\rtimes\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{[0]})$ symmetry.

Abstract:
We construct a $G$-cluster Hamiltonian in 2+1 dimensions and analyze its properties. This model exhibits a $G\times2\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ symmetry, where the $2\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ sector realizes a non-invertible symmetry obtained by condensing appropriate algebra objects in $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$. Using the symmetry interpolation method, we construct $S^1$- and $S^2$-parameterized families of short-range-entangled (SRE) states by interpolating an either invertible $0$-form or $1$-form symmetry contained in $G\times2\mathrm{Rep}(G)$. Applying an adiabatic evolution argument to this family, we analyze the pumped interface mode generated by this adiabatic process. We then explicitly construct the symmetry operator acting on the interface and show that the interface mode carries a nontrivial charge under this symmetry, thereby demonstrating the nontriviality of the parameterized family.

Abstract:
Quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes provide a practical balance between error-correction capability and implementation complexity in quantum error correction (QEC). In this paper, we propose an algebraic construction based on dyadic matrices for designing both classical and quantum LDPC codes. The method first generates classical binary quasi-dyadic LDPC codes whose Tanner graphs have girth 6. It is then extended to the Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) framework, where the two component parity-check matrices are built to satisfy the compatibility condition required by the recently introduced CAMEL-ensemble quaternary belief propagation decoder. This compatibility condition ensures that all unavoidable cycles of length 4 are assembled in a single variable node, allowing the mitigation of their detrimental effects by decimating that variable node.

Abstract:
Modern Quantum optics largely remains quasi-stationary, far from intrinsic optical field timescales. Ultrafast quantum optics seeks to generate, shape, and measure quantum states of light on femtosecond and attosecond timescales. Here we introduce a quantum light field squeezer (QLFS) that enables the generation and attosecond control of ultrafast broadband squeezed light. Using degenerate four-wave mixing in a quasi-collinear focusing geometry, our approach overcomes conventional broadband phase-matching limits, producing intensity- and phase-squeezed states directly from few-cycle laser pulses. Our ultrafast quantum optical metrology reveals a time-dependent squeezing distribution across individual half-cycles of the electric field. Incorporating this time-dependent squeezing into strong-field simulations shows that the temporal redistribution of quantum uncertainty reshapes the high-harmonic emission. Moreover, by tuning the relative pulse delay and phase-matching angle, we achieve attosecond precision in controlling the squeezing characteristics by visualizing inferred effective Wigner representations of the quantum light field. Beyond characterization, we demonstrate that the quantum light-induced tunneling-current noise is sensitive to the nonclassical intensity-noise statistics of the driving squeezed light, with sub-femtosecond control. Together, these results extend the generation, control, and effective phase-space representation of squeezed light into the ultrafast and attosecond regime, opening new avenues for quantum optics in strong-field and solid-state systems.

Abstract:
Computing functional determinants of differential operators is central to any field-theoretical calculation relying on a saddle-point expansion. A variety of approaches is available for the computation that avoid having to know the eigenspectrum of the operator, and in particular the Gel'fand-Yaglom theorem and the Green's function method. In this note, we show how both approaches can be constructed using a contour integral argument and conclude that these are completely equivalent for computing ratios of determinants of one-dimensional operators. Furthermore, we comment on the presence of vanishing as well as negative eigenvalues and show how the Green's function method provides a natural prescription for handling them.

Abstract:
We study Krylov complexity for quantum systems whose Hamiltonians factorise as tensor products. We prove that complexity is superadditive under tensor products, $C_{12}\ge C_1+C_2$, and identify a positive operator that quantifies the resulting excess complexity. The underlying mechanism is made transparent by introducing a Krylov graph representation in which tensor products generate a higher-dimensional lattice whose diagonal shells encode operator growth and binomial path multiplicities. In the continuum limit, Krylov dynamics reduces to diffusion on this graph, with superadditivity arising from geometric broadening across shells. Explicit examples illustrate how deviations from synchronous evolution generate bounded, oscillatory excess complexity.

Abstract:
Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have shown good success at classifying. However, the lack of explainability is a true and significant challenge, especially in high-stakes domains, such as health and finance, where understanding is paramount. We propose a new solution to this challenge: an explainable AI framework based on our comparative study with Quantum Boltzmann Machines (QBMs) and Classical Boltzmann Machines (CBMs). We leverage principles of quantum computing within classical machine learning to provide substantive transparency around decision-making. The design involves training both models on a binarised and dimensionally reduced MNIST dataset, where Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied for preprocessing. For interpretability, we employ gradient-based saliency maps in QBMs and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) in CBMs to evaluate feature attributions.QBMs deploy hybrid quantum-classical circuits with strongly entangling layers, allowing for richer latent representations, whereas CBMs serve as a classical baseline that utilises contrastive divergence. Along the way, we found that QBMs outperformed CBMs on classification accuracy (83.5% vs. 54%) and had more concentrated distributions in feature attributions as quantified by entropy (1.27 vs. 1.39). In other words, QBMs not only produced better predictive performance than CBMs, but they also provided clearer identification of "active ingredient" or the most important features behind model predictions. To conclude, our results illustrate that quantum-classical hybrid models can display improvements in both accuracy and interpretability, which leads us toward more trustworthy and explainable AI systems.

Abstract:
Magnetic phases are commonly identified through macroscopic magnetization, yet many ordered states, including antiferromagnets and altermagnets, possess a vanishing net moment despite distinct local spin structure. We show that such an order can be accessed through the measurement-induced steady state of a single primary qubit locally coupled to a spin lattice. Using a controlled primary-ancillary qubit protocol, we derive analytically that the steady state \emph{encodes} a locally weighted exchange field in a signed observable that is linear in the weak-coupling regime. Numerical simulations demonstrate lattice-scale resolution of antiferromagnetic and altermagnetic textures and robustness against short-correlated noise. Our results establish measurement-induced dissipation as a resource for detecting magnetic order through microscopic structure rather than through global moments.

Abstract:
String breaking, the process by which flux tubes fragment into hadronic states, is a hallmark of confinement in strongly-interacting quantum field theories. We examine a suite of quantum complexity measures using Matrix Product States to dissect the string breaking process in the 1+1D Schwinger model. We demonstrate the presence of nonlocal quantum correlations along the string that may affect fragmentation dynamics, and show that entanglement and magic offer complementary perspectives on string formation and breaking beyond conventional observables.

Abstract:
Several recent studies have suggested that incompatible variables, which play an essential role in quantum mechanics (QM), are, somewhat surprisingly, not necessarily unique to QM. To investigate this possibility and obtain a better understanding of two central postulates of QM, namely the commutator postulate and the Born postulate, we introduce a classical probabilistic theoretical framework which is more general than QM and contains QM as a special case. We call this framework the General Incompatible Variables (GIV) theory, and we show that not only QM systems but also any probabilistic systems (classical or quantal) that possess incompatible variables will exhibit the quantal properties of uncertainty and interference, and we illustrate this with a roulette-like classical system (which we call the Arrow) that shows precisely these properties. We show that QM emerges naturally from the GIV framework when the fundamental variables are taken to be symmetries, so that the incompatibility of the QM variables is actually just the incompatibility of the corresponding symmetries (or their generators). Specifically, when the variables are taken to be the elements of the Poincare group (the symmetry of spacetime) we find that the commutator postulate and the Born postulate follow automatically, and are therefore no longer postulates. QM thus emerges as a special case of GIV theories for which the variables are symmetries.

Abstract:
Superposed orders of quantum channels have already been proved - both theoretically and experimentally - to enable unparalleled opportunities in the quantum communication domain. As a matter of fact, superposition of orders can be exploited within the quantum computing domain as well, by relaxing the (traditional) assumption underlying quantum computation about applying gates in a well-defined causal order. In this context, we address a fundamental question arising with quantum computing: whether superposed orders of single-qubit gates can enable universal quantum computation. As shown in this paper, the answer to this key question is a definitive "yes". Indeed, we prove that any two-qubit controlled quantum gate can be deterministically realized, including the so-called Barenco gate that alone enables universal quantum computation.

Abstract:
We formulate a quantum phase space for rotational and nuclear-spin states of rigid molecules. For each nuclear spin isomer, we re-derive the isomer's admissible angular momentum states from molecular geometry and nuclear-spin data, introduce its angular position states using quantization theory, and develop a generalized Fourier transform converting between the two. We classify molecules into three types -- asymmetric, rotationally symmetric, and perrotationally symmetric -- with the last type having no macroscopic analogue due to nuclear-spin statistics constraints. We discuss two general features in perrotationally symmetric state spaces that are Hamiltonian-independent and induced solely by symmetry and spin statistics. First, we quantify when and how an isomer's state space is completely rotation-spin entangled, meaning that it does not admit any separable states. Second, we identify isomers whose position states house an internal pseudo-spin or "fiber" degree of freedom, and the fiber's Berry phase or matrix after adiabatic changes in position yields naturally robust operations, akin to braiding anyonic quasiparticles or realizing fault-tolerant quantum gates. We outline how the fiber can be used as a quantum error-correcting code and discuss scenarios where these features can be experimentally probed

Abstract:
Superconducting and photonic technologies are envisioned to play a key role in the Quantum Internet. However the hybridization of these technologies requires functional quantum transducers for converting superconducting qubits, exploited in quantum computation, into ``flying'' qubits, able to propagate through the network (and vice-versa). In this paper, quantum transduction is theoretically investigated for a key functionality of the Quantum Internet, namely, multipartite entanglement distribution. Different communication models for quantum transduction are provided, in order to make the entanglement distribution possible. The proposed models departs from the large heterogeneity of hardware solutions available in literature, abstracting from the particulars of the specific solutions with a communication engineering perspective. Then, a performance analysis of the proposed models is conducted through key communication metrics, such as quantum capacity and entanglement generation probability. The analysis reveals that -- although the considered communication metrics depend on transduction hardware parameters for all the proposed models -- the particulars of the considered transduction paradigm play a relevant role in the overall entanglement distribution performance.

Abstract:
We numerically investigate the stability of exceptional periodic classical trajectories in rather generic chaotic many-body systems and explore a possible connection between these trajectories and exceptional nonthermal quantum eigenstates known as "quantum many-body scars". The systems considered are chaotic spin chains with short-range interactions, both classical and quantum. On the classical side, the chosen periodic trajectories are such that all spins instantaneously point in the same direction, which evolves as a function of time. We find that the largest Lyapunov exponents characterising the stabillity of these trajectories have surprisingly strong and nontrivial dependencies on the interaction constants and chain lengths. In particular, we identify rather long spin chains, where the above periodic trajectories are Lyapunov-stable on many-body energy shells overwhelmingly dominated by chaotic motion. We also find that instabilities around periodic trajectories in modestly large spin chains develop into a transient nearly quasiperiodic non-ergodic regime. In some cases, the lifetime of this regime is extremely long, which we interpret as a manifestation of Arnold diffusion in the vicinity of integrable dynamics. On the quantum side, we numerically investigate the dynamics of quantum states starting with all spins initially pointing in the same direction: these are the quantum counterparts of the initial conditions for the above periodic classical trajectories. Our investigation reveals the existence of quantum many-body scars for numerically accessible finite chains of spins 3/2 and higher. The dynamic thermalisation process dominated by quantum scars is shown to exhibit a slowdown in comparison with generic thermalisation at the same energy. Finally, we identify quantum signatures of the proximity to a classical separatrix of the periodic motion.

Abstract:
We consider the task of performing shadow tomography of a logical subsystem defined via the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) error correcting code. Our protocol does not require the input state to be a code state but is implemented by appropriate twirling of the measurement channel, such that the encoded logical tomographic information becomes encoded in the classical shadow. We showcase this protocol for measurements natural in continuous variable (CV) quantum computing. For heterodyne measurement, the protocol yields a probabilistic decomposition of any input state into Gaussian states that simulate the encoded logical information of the input relative to a fixed GKP code where we prove bounds on the Gaussian compressibility of states in this setting. For photon parity measurements, our protocol is equivalent to a Wigner sampling protocol for which we develop the appropriate sampling strategies. Finally, by randomizing over the reference GKP code, we show how Wigner samples of any input state relative to a random GKP codes can be used to estimate any sufficiently bounded observable.

Abstract:
The Quantum Internet would likely be composed of diverse qubit technologies that interact through a heterogeneous quantum network. Thus, quantum transduction has been identified as a key enabler of the Quantum Internet. To better study heterogeneous quantum networks, the integration of a quantum transducer component into quantum network simulators has become crucial. In this paper, we extend SeQUeNCe, an open-source, discrete-event simulator of quantum networks, with a quantum transduction component along with auxiliary hardware device models and protocols. Moreover, we explore two strategies for transmitting quantum information between superconducting nodes via optical channels, with a focus on the impact of quantum transduction on the transmission process. The performance of these strategies is analyzed and compared through simulations conducted using SeQUeNCe. Our results align with theoretical predictions, offering simulation-based validation of the strategies and providing a path to accurate, larger-scale simulations of heterogeneous quantum networks.

Abstract:
The ability to physically move qubits within a register allows the design of hardware-specific error-correction codes, which can achieve fault-tolerance while respecting other constraints. In particular, recent advancements have demonstrated the shuttling of electron and hole spin qubits through a quantum dot array with high fidelity. It is therefore timely to explore error correction architectures consisting merely of two parallel quantum dot arrays, an experimentally validated architecture compatible with classical wiring and control constraints. Upon such an architecture, we develop a suite of heuristic methods for compiling any Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) error-correcting code's syndrome-extraction circuit to run with a reduced number of shuttling operations. We demonstrate how column-regular qLDPC codes can be compiled in a provably minimal number of shuttles that is exactly equal to the column weight of the code when Shor-style syndrome extraction is used. We provide tables stating the number of required shuttles for many contemporary codes of interest. In addition, we provide a proof of the NP hardness of minimizing the number of shuttle operations for general codes, even when using Shor syndrome extraction. We also discuss how one could get around this by placing blanks in the ancilla array to achieve minimal shuttles with Shor syndrome extraction on any CSS code, at the cost of longer ancilla arrays.

Abstract:
Magic is a quantum resource essential for universal quantum computation and represents the deviation of quantum states from those that can be simulated efficiently using classical algorithms. Using the Stabilizer Rényi Entropy (SRE), we investigate two-qubit states with maximal magic, which are most distinct from classical simulability, and provide strong numerical evidence that the maximal second order SRE is $\ln (16/7)\approx 0.827$, establishing a tighter bound than the prior $\ln (5/2)\approx 0.916$. We identify 480 states saturating the new bound, which turn out to be the fiducial states for the mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) generated by the orbits of the Weyl-Heisenberg (WH) group, and conjecture that WH-MUBs are the maximal magic states for $n$-qubit, when $n\neq 1$ and 3. We also reveal a striking interplay between magic and entanglement: the entanglement of maximal magic states is restricted to two possible values, $1/2$ and $1/\sqrt{2}$, as quantified by the concurrence; none is maximally entangled.

Abstract:
The Cramér-Rao bound captures completely the performance of single-parameter quantum sensors. On the other hand, its extension to multiple parameters demands more caution. Different aspects need to be captured at once, including, critically, compatibility. In this article we consider compatibility in quantum interferometry for an important class of probe states, measured by double homodyne or photon counters, standard benchmarks for these applications. We include the presence of loss and phase diffusion in the estimation of a phase. Our results illustrate how different weighting of the precision on individual parameters affects their compatibility, adding to the list of considerations for quantum multiparameter estimation.

Abstract:
The complementary features of different qubit platforms for computing and communicating impose an intrinsic hardware heterogeneity in any quantum network, where nodes, while processing and storing quantum information, must also communicate through quantum links. Indeed, one of the most promising hardware platforms at quantum node scale for scalable and fast quantum computing is the superconducting technology, which operates at microwave frequencies. Whereas, for communicating at distances of practical interest beyond few meters, quantum links should operate at optical frequencies. Therefore, to allow the interaction between superconducting and photonic technologies, a quantum interface, known as quantum transducer, able to convert one type of qubit to another is required. This paper aims to provide a tutorial treatise on the fundamental research challenges of quantum transduction. The tutorial is structured around a communications engineering framework, thereby shedding light on its fundamental role in quantum network design and deployment -- a perspective often overlooked in existing literature. This framework allows us to categorize different transduction modalities and to reveal an unorthodox one where the transducer itself can act as an entanglement source. From this standpoint, it is possible to conceive different source-destination link archetypes, where transduction plays a crucial role in the communication performances. The analysis also translates the quantum transduction process into a proper functional block within a new communication system model for a quantum network.

Abstract:
Simulating Clifford and near-Clifford circuits using the extended stabilizer formalism has become increasingly popular, particularly in quantum error correction. Compared to the state-vector approach, the extended stabilizer formalism can solve the same problems with fewer computational resources, as it operates on stabilizers rather than full state vectors. Most existing studies on near-Clifford circuits focus on balancing the trade-off between the number of ancilla qubits and simulation accuracy, often overlooking performance considerations. Furthermore, in the presence of high-rank stabilizers, performance is limited by the sequential property of the stabilizer formalism. In this work, we introduce a parallelized version of the extended stabilizer formalism, enabling efficient execution on multi-core devices such as GPU. Experimental results demonstrate that, in certain scenarios, our Python-based implementation outperforms state-of-the-art simulators such as Qiskit and Pennylane.

Abstract:
Single-molecule magnets (SMMs) are molecules that can function as nanoscale magnets with potential use as magnetic memory bits. While SMMs can retain magnetization at low temperatures, characterizing them on surface and at room temperature remains challenging and requires specialized nanoscale techniques. Here, we use single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as highly sensitive, broadband magnetic field sensors to detect the magnetic noise of cobalt-based SMMs deposited on a diamond surface. We measure the NV relaxation and decoherence times at 296 K and at 5-8 K, observing a significant influence of the SMMs on them. From this, we can infer the SMMs' magnetic noise spectral density (NSD) and underlying magnetic properties. Moreover, we observe the effect of an applied magnetic field on the SMMs' NSD at low temperatures. The method provides nanoscale sensitivity for characterizing SMMs under realistic conditions relevant to their use as surface-bound memory units.

Preparing the thermal density matrix $ρ_β \propto e^{-βH}$ corresponding to a given Hamiltonian $H$ is a task of central interest across quantum many-body physics, and is particularly salient when attempting to study it with quantum computers. Although solved in principle by recent constructions of efficiently simulable Lindblad master equations -- that provably have $ρ_β$ as a steady state [C.-F.~Chen \emph{et al.}, Nature \textbf{646}, pp.~561--566 (2025)] -- the implementation of these ``exact Gibbs samplers'' requires large-scale quantum computational resources and is hence challenging \emph{in practice} on current or even near-term quantum devices.   Here, we propose a scheme for approximately simulating an exact Gibbs sampler that only requires the repeated implementation of three readily available ingredients: (a) analog simulation of $H$; (b) strictly local but time-dependent couplings to ancilla qubits; and (c) reset of the ancillas. We give rigorous guarantees on the difference between the fixed point reached by our protocol and the exact thermal state, which only depend on parameters of the protocol and its \emph{mixing time}. The procedure is efficiently implementable on near-term devices if $H$ is local, and the mixing time scales mildly with both system size and protocol parameters. While guaranteeing the latter for Hamiltonians of interest remains an important problem for future work, here we lay the groundwork for developing fully efficient thermal state preparation protocols on quantum simulators.

Abstract:
Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution (CV-QKD) and Quantum Random Number Generation (CV-QRNG) are critical technologies for secure communication and high-speed randomness generation, exploiting shot-noise-limited coherent detection for their operation. Integrated photonic solutions are key to advancing these protocols, as they enable compact, scalable, and efficient system implementations. In this work, we introduce Femtosecond Laser Micromachining (FLM) on borosilicate glass as a novel platform for producing Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs) realizing coherent detection suitable for quantum information processing. We exploit the specific features of FLM to produce a PIC designed for CV-QKD and CV-QRNG applications. The PIC features fully adjustable optical components that achieve precise calibration and reliable operation under protocol-defined conditions. The device exhibits low insertion losses ($\leq 1.28$ dB), polarization-insensitive operation, and a Common-Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR) exceeding 73 dB. These characteristics allowed the experimental realization of a source-device-independent CV-QRNG with a secure generation rate of 42.74 Gbps and a QPSK-based CV-QKD system achieving a secret key rate of 3.2 Mbit/s. Our results highlight the potential of FLM technology as an integrated photonic platform, paving the way for scalable and high-performing quantum communication systems.

Abstract:
A reinforcement learning (RL) framework is introduced for the efficient synthesis of quantum circuits that generate specified target quantum states from a fixed initial state, addressing a central challenge in both the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era and future fault-tolerant quantum computing. The approach utilizes tabular Q-learning, based on action sequences, within a discretized quantum state space, to effectively manage the exponential growth of the space dimension.The framework introduces a hybrid reward mechanism, combining a static, domain-informed reward that guides the agent toward the target state with customizable dynamic penalties that discourage inefficient circuit structures such as gate congestion and redundant state revisits. This is a circuit-aware reward, in contrast to the current trend of works on this topic, which are primarily fidelity-based. By leveraging sparse matrix representations and state-space discretization, the method enables practical navigation of high-dimensional environments while minimizing computational overhead. Benchmarking on graph-state preparation tasks for up to seven qubits, we demonstrate that the algorithm consistently discovers minimal-depth circuits with optimized gate counts. Moreover, extending the framework to a universal gate set still yields low depth circuits, highlighting the algorithm robustness and adaptability. The results confirm that this RL-driven approach, with our completely circuit-aware method, efficiently explores the complex quantum state space and synthesizes near-optimal quantum circuits, providing a resource-efficient foundation for quantum circuit optimization.

Abstract:
We construct stabilizer states and error-correcting codes on combinations of discrete- and continuous-variable systems, generalizing the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) quantum lattice formalism. Our framework absorbs the discrete phase space of a qudit into a hybrid phase space parameterizable entirely by the continuous variables of a harmonic oscillator. The unit cell of a hybrid quantum lattice grows with the qudit dimension, yielding a way to simultaneously measure an arbitrarily large range of non-commuting position and momentum displacements. Simple hybrid states can be obtained by applying a conditional displacement to a Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) state and a Pauli eigenstate, or by encoding some of the physical qudits of a stabilizer state into a GKP code. The states' oscillator-qudit entanglement cannot be generated using symplectic (i.e., Gaussian-Clifford) operations, distinguishing them as a resource from tensor products of oscillator and qudit stabilizer states.   Simple hybrid codes can be thought of as subsystem GKP codes whose gauge factor is entangled with a qudit. Our numerical investigations suggest that such codes can sometimes outperform GKP codes against physical noise, and their decoders can be tuned to accommodate either more qudit or more oscillator errors. We also relate stabilizer codes to non-commutative tori, identifying that a general construction of such tori yields multi-mode multi-qudit extensions of GKP codes. We explicitly calculate these codes' logical dimension and logical operators by utilizing the Morita equivalence between their stabilizer and logical tori. We provide examples using commutation matrices, integer symplectic matrices, and binary codes.

Abstract:
We experimentally demonstrate efficient interfacing of a large number of atoms to an optical nanofiber using an optical lattice with tunable spacing ($0.88-1.5~μ$m) projected onto the nanofiber. The lattice beam and reflections from the nanofiber yield trap potentials that provide tight confinement in all motional degrees of freedom $\approx 220$ nm above the nanofiber surface, enabling efficient atom-photon coupling. We achieve trapping of $\approx1300$ atoms in periodic trap sites with a trap lifetime of $\approx15$ ms. We also observe the effect of varied lattice periods on the atomic motional frequencies. Our new scheme is adaptable to other nanophotonic cold-atom systems and provides a versatile and scalable platform for studying photon-mediated long-range collective interactions.

Abstract:
A classical obfuscator for quantum circuits is a classical program that, given the classical description of a quantum circuit $Q$, outputs the classical description of a functionally equivalent quantum circuit $\hat{Q}$ that hides as much as possible about $Q$. Previously, the only known feasibility result for classical obfuscation of quantum circuits (Bartusek and Malavolta, ITCS 2022) was limited to circuits that always reject. On the other hand, if the obfuscator is allowed to compile the quantum circuit $Q$ into a quantum state $|\hat{Q}\rangle$, there exist feasibility results for obfuscating all pseudo-deterministic quantum circuits (Bartusek, Kitagawa, Nishimaki and Yamakawa, STOC 2023, Bartusek, Brakerski and Vaikuntanathan, STOC 2024), and all unitaries (Huang and Tang, FOCS 2025).   We show that (relative to a classical oracle) there exists a classical obfuscator for all pseudo-deterministic quantum circuits. We do this by giving the first construction of a compact quantum fully-homomorphic encryption (QFHE) scheme that supports public verification of (pseudo-deterministic) quantum evaluation, relative to a classical oracle.   To construct our QFHE scheme, we improve on the approach of Bartusek, Kitagawa, Nishimaki and Yamakawa (STOC 2023), which required ciphertexts that are both quantum and non-compact due to the use of quantum coset states and their publicly-verifiable properties. We introduce new techniques for analyzing coset states that can be generated ''on the fly'', by proving new cryptographic properties of the one-shot signature scheme of Shmueli and Zhandry (CRYPTO 2025). Our techniques allow us to produce QFHE ciphertexts that are purely classical, compact, and publicly-verifiable. This also yields the first classical verification of quantum computation protocol for BQP that simultaneously satisfies blindness and public-verifiability.

Abstract:
This work theoretically investigates possibilities of using the Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP) and its variants to control a coherent superposition of quantum states. We present a generalization of the so-called fractional STIRAP (f-STIRAP), demonstrating precise control over the mixing ratio of quantum states in the wave packet. In contrast to conventional f-STIRAP, designed to drive a system from an eigenstate into a coherent superposition, our scheme enables arbitrary control over the composition of an already existing superposition state. We demonstrate that an approximate version of this technique -- where analytically designed laser pulses with composite envelopes are replaced by simple Gaussian pulses -- achieves comparable performance in controlling the dynamics of the wave packet. A limiting case of this scheme, utilizing two pulses with identical Gaussian envelopes and tuned delay and relative phase, is also explored, revealing experimentally accessible pathways for manipulating quantum coherence. We apply our developed techniques to control the ultrafast charge migration in the spin-orbit split ground electronic states of xenon cation via intermediate valence- and core-excited states. Finally, we propose concrete experimental realizations of the developed control schemes in combination with attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy as a method to probe the system.

Abstract:
Neural Quantum States (NQS) are powerful tools used to represent complex quantum many-body states in an increasingly wide range of applications. However, despite their popularity, at present only a rudimentary understanding of their limitations exists. In this work, we investigate the dependence of NQS on the choice of the computational basis, focusing on restricted Boltzmann machines. Considering a family of rotated Hamiltonians corresponding to the paradigmatic transverse-field Ising model, we discuss the properties of ground states responsible for the dependence of NQS performance, namely the presence of ground state degeneracies as well as the uniformity of amplitudes and phases, carefully examining their interplay. We identify that the basis-dependence of the performance is linked to the convergence properties of a cluster or cumulant expansion of multi-spin operators -- providing a framework to directly connect physical, basis-dependent properties, to performance itself. Our results provide insights that may be used to gauge the applicability of NQS to new problems and to identify the optimal basis for numerical computations.

Abstract:
Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) admits a topological \(\barθ\)-term that violates Charge-Parity \((CP)\) symmetry, yet experimental indicate that \(\barθ\) is nearly zero. To investigate this discrepancy in a controlled setting, we derive the Hamiltonian representation of the QCD Lagrangian and construct its \((1{+}1)\)-dimensional Schwinger-model analogue. By encoding fermionic and gauge degrees of freedom into qubits using the Jordan-Wigner and quantum-link schemes, we obtain a compact Pauli Hamiltonian that retains the relevant topological vacuum structure. Ground states are evaluated using a feedback-based quantum optimization protocol, enabling numerical evaluation of the vacuum energy \(E_0(\barθ)\) on a few-qubit simulator. Our results show a vacuum at \(\barθ= 0\ (\text{mod 2})\) in agreement with strong-interaction expectations, and demonstrate that introducing a dynamical axion field drives the system toward a \(θ_{\rm eff}=0\), thereby realizing the Peccei-Quinn mechanism within a minimal quantum simulation. These results illustrate how quantum hardware can examine symmetry violation and its dynamical resolution in gauge theories.

Abstract:
Quantum computers pose a fundamental threat to widely deployed public-key cryptosystems, such as RSA and ECC, by enabling efficient integer factorization using Shor's algorithm. Theoretical resource estimates suggest that 2048-bit RSA keys could be broken using Shor's algorithm with fewer than a million noisy qubits. Although such machines do not yet exist, the availability of smaller, cloud-accessible quantum processors and open-source implementations of Shor's algorithm raises the question of what key sizes can realistically be factored with today's platforms. In this work, we experimentally investigate Shor's algorithm on several cloud-based quantum computers using publicly available implementations. Our results reveal a substantial gap between the capabilities of current quantum hardware and the requirements for factoring cryptographically relevant integers. In particular, we observe that circuit constructions still need to be highly specific for each modulus, and that machine fidelities are unstable, with high and fluctuating error rates.

Abstract:
Floquet codes have recently emerged as a new family of error-correcting codes, and have drawn significant interest across both theoretical and practical quantum computing. A central open question has been how to implement logical operations on these codes. In this work, we show how two techniques from static quantum error-correcting codes can also be implemented on Floquet codes. First, we present a way of implementing fold-transversal operations on Floquet codes in order to yield logical Hadamard and S gates. And second, we present a way of implementing logical CNOT gates on Floquet codes via Dehn twists. We discuss the requirements for these techniques, and show that they are applicable to a wide family of Floquet codes defined on colour code lattices. Through numerical benchmarking of the logical operations on the CCS Floquet code, we establish a logical-gate threshold of 0.25-0.35% and verify sub-threshold exponential error suppression. Our results show that these logical operations are robust, featuring a performance that is close to the baseline set by a quantum memory benchmark. Finally, we explain in detail how to implement logical gates on Floquet codes by operating on the embedded codes.

Abstract:
Recent advances in time-resolved cathodoluminescence have enabled ultrafast studies of single emitters in quantum materials with femtosecond temporal resolution. Here, we develop a quantum theory modeling the dynamics of free electrons interacting with quantum emitters in arbitrary initial states. Our analysis reveals that a free electron can induce transient coherent oscillations in the populations when the system is initially prepared in a coherent superposition of its states. Moreover, the electron energy spectrum exhibits a clear signature of the quantum coherence and sensitivity to the transition frequency of the emitter. These coherence effects manifest themselves as oscillations in the zero-loss peak of the spectral energy-loss probability. Our findings pave the way for characterization of quantum-coherent dynamics of individual quantum emitters by electron-probes.

Abstract:
We present an exact, time-dependent solution for a two-dimensional Pauli oscillator deformed by Dunkl operators in the presence of an Aharonov--Bohm (AB) flux. By replacing conventional momenta with Dunkl momenta and allowing arbitrary time dependence in both, mass and frequency, we derive a deformed Pauli Hamiltonian that encodes reflection symmetries and topological gauge phases. Employing the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant method, we derive exact expressions for the eigenvalues and spinor eigenfunctions of the system. Crucially, the AB flux imposes symmetry constraints on the Dunkl parameters of the form $ν_1 = \mp ν_2 $, linking the reflection symmetry ($ε= \pm 1 $) to the quantization of angular momentum. These constraints modify the energy spectrum and wavefunctions of the angular operator and the invariant operator. Our framework reveals novel spectral characteristics arising from the interplay between topology and Dunkl symmetry, with potential implications for quantum simulation in engineered systems such as cold atoms and quantum dots.

Divergent solutions are ubiquitous with perturbation methods. We use continued function such as continued exponential to converge divergent series in perturbation approaches for energy eigenvalues of Helium, Stark effect and Zeeman effect on Hydrogen. We observe that convergence properties are obtained similar to that of the Padé approximation which is extensively used in literature. Free parameters are not used which influence the convergence and only first few terms in the perturbation series are implemented.

Abstract:
Scalable quantum information processing with integrated photonics requires quantum logic operations with high fidelity and robustness. Directional couplers, the fundamental elements enabling quantum interference and logic operations, are inherently sensitive to fabrication imperfections and environmental fluctuations, leading to reduced gate fidelities. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a passive design strategy that mitigates these errors by exploiting a stationary geometrical configuration in uniform directional couplers, where first-order variations in the coupling coefficient are intrinsically suppressed. The robust geometry is implemented in a silicon-on-insulator photonic chip hosting two-photon controlled-NOT (CNOT) quantum gates and its performance is directly compared to a non-optimized design. Measurements indicate a mean gate fidelity of $93.30 \pm 0.11\%$, representing a clear improvement over the non-robust implementation mean fidelity of $91.93 \pm 0.17\%$, without any active tuning or footprint increase. This performance approaches the theoretical limit of $93.78\%$, imposed by the imperfect source. Monte Carlo simulations incorporating realistic fabrication noise confirm the observed enhancement and reveal consistent suppression of gate-level error rates. These results demonstrate a compact, fabrication-tolerant building block for scalable, fault-tolerant photonic quantum circuits and highlight the power of passive geometric error mitigation in quantum hardware design.

Abstract:
Improving the coherence of superconducting qubits is essential for advancing quantum technologies. While superconductors are theoretically perfect conductors, they consistently exhibit residual energy dissipation when driven by microwave currents, limiting coherence times. Here, we report a universal scaling between microwave dissipation and the superfluid density, a bulk property of superconductors related to charge carrier density and disorder. Our analysis spans a wide range of superconducting materials and device geometries, from highly disordered amorphous films to ultra-clean systems with record-high quality factors, including resonators, 3D cavities, and transmon qubits. This scaling reveals an intrinsic bulk dissipation channel, independent of surface dielectric losses, that originates from a universal density of nonequilibrium quasiparticles trapped within disorder-induced spatial variations of the superconducting gap. Our findings identify an empirical coherence limit associated with intrinsic material properties and provide a data-driven basis for materials selection in future superconducting quantum circuits.

Abstract:
Three-body Förster resonances controlled by a dc electric field are of interest for the implementation of three-qubit quantum gates with single atoms in optical traps using their laser excitation into strongly interacting Rydberg states. In our recent theoretical paper [Zh. Eksper. Teor. Fiz. 168(1), 14 (2025)] it was found that the proposed earlier three-body Förster resonance $3\times nP_{3/2} \to nS_{1/2} +(n+1)S_{1/2} +nP_{1/2} $ in Rb Rydberg atoms has a splitting, with one of the split components having weaker dependence of the resonant electric field (and the corresponding dynamic shift) on the distance $R$ between the atoms. Here we study this effect in more detail, since such a resonance is the most suitable for performing experiments on observing coherent oscillations of populations of collective three-body states and implementing three-qubit quantum gates based on them. For a linear spatial configuration of three interacting Rydberg atoms, the physical mechanism of this phenomenon is revealed and analytical formulas are obtained that describe the behavior of split structure of the Förster resonance depending on $R$. It is found that the splitting is a measure of the energy of the resonant dipole-dipole exchange interaction with an excitation hopping between neighboring Rydberg states $S$ and $P$.

Manovitz et al., Nature \textbf{638}, 86 (2025)]: an apparent speeding up of the coarsening process as the phase transition is approached; and persistent oscillations of the order parameter after quenches within the ordered phase. Our theory, based on the Hamiltonian structure of the equations of motion in the classical limit of the quantum model, finds a speeding up already deep within the ordered phase, with subsequent slowing down as the domain wall tension vanishes upon approaching the critical line. Further, the oscillations are captured within a mean-field treatment of the order parameter field. For quenches within the ordered phase, small spatially-varying fluctuations in the initial mean-field lead to a remarkable long-time effect, wherein the system dynamically destroys its long-range order and has to coarsen to re-establish it. We term this phenomenon \emph{symmetry re-breaking}, as the resulting late-time magnetization can have a sign opposite to the initial magnetization.

Abstract:
The Spectral Form Factor (SFF) is defined as the modulus squared of the partition function in complex temperature for hermitian matrices and a suitable generalisation has been given in the non hermitian case. In this work we compute the properties of the quenched SFF for hermitian and non hermitian random matrices. Despite the fact that the (annealed) SFF is not self-averaging the quenched SFF is self-averaging but these two averages coincide up to subleading constants (at least for high enough temperatures). The fluctuations of $\log \mathrm{SFF}$ are deep and one encounters thin spikes when moving close to a zero of the partition function. We study the partition function at late times by considering a suitable change of variable which turns out to be compatible with a Gumbel distribution. We note that the exponential tails of this distribution can be obtained by the deep spikes in the $\log \mathrm{SFF}$, namely the zeros of the partition function. We compare with the results obtained in isolated many-body systems and we show that same results hold at late times also for non-hermitian Hamiltonains and non-hermitian random matrices.

Abstract:
Building on the infinite-component Chern-Simons theory of three-dimensional fracton phases by Ma et al. [Phys. Rev. B 105, 195124 (2022)] and the Toeplitz braiding of anyons by Li et al. [Phys. Rev. B 110, 205108 (2024)], we show that stacking $(3+1)$D $BF$ topological field theories along a fourth spatial direction gives rise to an exotic class of four-dimensional fracton phases. Their low-energy physics is governed by a new field-theoretic framework -- infinite-component $BF$ (i$BF$) theories -- characterized by asymmetric integer Toeplitz $K$ matrices. Under open boundary conditions, i$BF$ theories exhibit a striking phenomenon: \textit{Toeplitz particle-loop braiding}, where a particle and a loop placed on opposite three-dimensional boundaries acquire a finite braiding phase even at infinite separation. This nonlocal braiding admits a geometric interpretation: transporting the particle induces a winding boundary trajectory on the opposite boundary that encircles the loop. We show that this robustness originates from boundary zero singular modes (ZSMs) of Toeplitz $K$ matrices revealed by singular value decomposition (SVD), rather than from the eigenvalue zero modes responsible for previously known Toeplitz braiding of anyons. We analytically and numerically study representative i$BF$ theories with Hatano-Nelson-type and non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger--type $K$ matrices, establishing a universal correspondence between ZSMs and Toeplitz particle-loop braiding. Our results identify boundary zero singular modes as the mechanism behind Toeplitz particle-loop braiding and establish infinite-component $BF$ theory as a predictive framework for higher-dimensional fracton topological orders.

Abstract:
We present a unified quantum open system framework for lossy plasmonic cavities in which coherent dynamics, relaxation, dephasing, and irreversible absorption are treated on equal footing. The Dyson equation for the cavity photon propagator in the random-phase approximation yields a complex self-energy S that accounts for both the renormalization and the damping of hybrid plasmon-photon modes (polaritons, in a quasi-particle description). Tracing out the electronic and photonic environments leads to a Liouvillian for the upper (UP) and lower (LP) polaritonic branches, incorporating leakage through the imaginary part of the self-energy, internal UP-LP scattering rates, and dephasing. Time evolution equations for polariton populations, interbranch coherence, and driven amplitudes in closed form also provide analytic expressions for their steady-state values, the quench rate of UP-LP oscillations and polaritonic lineshapes, valid in the limit of low polaritonic density, but covering light-matter ultrastrong coupling. The theory establishes a self-consistent description of dissipative polariton dynamics in plasmonic and nanophotonic cavities, directly applicable to response spectra, time-domain measurements, and dissipation engineering.

Abstract:
We show that a two-proton emitter with a diproton-correlated initial state can act as a source of spin-correlated proton pairs. Using a time-dependent three-body model, we investigate the two-proton emission of $^{16}$Ne ($^{14}$O$+2p$) and analyze the spin correlation of the emitted protons. We find that, when the emission proceeds as a democratic three-body process from an initial state containing a spin-singlet diproton correlation, the emitted protons exhibit a pronounced spin-correlation pattern exceeding the local-hidden-variable bound. This spin correlation closely resembles that of a pure spin-singlet pair. In contrast, this pattern is lost when the process is dominated by the sequential emission or when the initial diproton correlation is absent. These results demonstrate that a certain class of two-proton emitters can deliver spin-entangled proton pairs, and their spin correlation reflects the diproton correlation embedded in the initial state.

Abstract:
Adiabatic topological pumping enables robust transport of energy and information, yet its operational speed is fundamentally constrained by the instantaneous adiabatic condition, which necessitates prohibitively slow parameter variations. Here, we propose a paradigm shift from instantaneous to global adiabaticity. We derive a global adiabatic criterion (GAC) that establishes an absolute fidelity bound by controlling the root-mean-square nonadiabaticity. Building on this framework, we introduce a fluctuation-suppression acceleration criterion to minimize spatial inhomogeneity, allowing for a safe increase in mean nonadiabaticity without compromising fidelity. We experimentally demonstrate this principle in femtosecond-laser-written photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger waveguide arrays via scalable power-law coupling modulation. Our accelerated topological pumping achieves a fidelity of >0.95 with a fivefold reduction in device length compared to conventional schemes, exhibits the predicted linear scaling with system size, and maintains robust performance across a bandwidth exceeding 400 nm. This GAC framework provides a universal design rule for fast, compact, and robust adiabatic devices across both quantum and classical topological platforms.

Abstract:
Multi-photon-added cat states are constructed by repeatedly applying the creation operator to a cat state. We study in detail their photon-number distribution, $Q$ parameter, squeezing properties, and Wigner function. We show that photon addition induces a $π$ phase shift in the original parity configuration whenever an odd number of photons is added, reflected as swapped vanishing probabilities and phase space displacements at the origin. Remarkably, the same process drives these states into a sub-Poissonian regime regardless of the relative phase between their coherent state components, making them valuable resources for quantum imaging, at the cost of losing quadrature squeezing, but gaining amplitude-squared one. We also discuss how these states can be generated using existing hardware.

Abstract:
Rapid and programmable shaping of light fields is central to modern microscopy, display technologies, optical communications and sensing, quantum engineering, and quantum information processing. Current wavefront shaping technologies face a fundamental dichotomy: spatial light modulators (SLMs) offer high pixel count but suffer from low refresh rates, while acousto-optic deflectors (AODs) provide moderate speed with restricted optical beam geometries. Though recent advances in photonic integrated circuits achieve fast switching, there is currently no tool that provides MHz-rate, continuous motion, and arbitrarily reconfigurable control over a set of diffraction-limited spots. Here we introduce a new class of spatial light modulator that provides both 2D pixel geometry and high speed. The device operates by encoding spatial information in frequency bins via a broadband optical phase modulator, and decoding them via a first-of-its-kind, high-resolution 2D spectrometer. The spectrometer, based on the architecture which we call the Re-Imaging Phased Array (RIPA), achieves its sensitivity through long path-lengths, enabled by intra-spectrometer re-imaging lens-guides. We demonstrate site-resolved optical pulsing with a 44(1)~ns rise time, corresponding to frame rates exceeding 10 million frames per second, as well as arbitrary, reconfigurable 2D addressing and multi-site operations, including asynchronous, independent beam motion, splitting, and recombination. Leveraging these tools opens new horizons in rapid optical manipulation of matter across science, from fast, scalable control that approaches the inertial and radiation limits of atoms in quantum processors, to dynamically programmable, microsecond-resolved illumination in microscopy and neuro-biological imaging.

Abstract:
We demonstrate superadditivity of one-shot zero-error classical capacity in an asymmetric communication setting where a noisy classical channel is used in parallel with a perfect quantum channel. Each channel individually supports only a fixed number of perfectly distinguishable messages. Their joint use enables transmission of strictly more messages than permitted by the product of the individual capacities. We present explicit constructions achieving this enhancement and establish that replacing the perfect quantum channel with a perfect classical channel eliminates the effect. Finally, we identify a structural criterion on the noisy channel governing this effect and show that the quantum advantage is rooted in Kochen-Specker contextuality.

Abstract:
Tweezer arrays of polar molecules present new opportunities for quantum science and quantum information. However, a major challenge, especially in bialkali molecule platforms, is the fact that current measurement schemes for the internal states are destructive. In this work, we present a method to use Rydberg atoms to nondestructively measure the internal state of a molecular qubit. We achieve this via microwave dressing of both molecules and Rydberg atoms, allowing us to tune the interactions so that there are minimal Rydberg-Rydberg interactions and many measurements can take place simultaneously. We consider two experimentally-motivated examples of detecting $^{23}$Na$^{133}$Cs and $^{87}$Rb$^{133}$Cs with $^{133}$Cs atoms. Finally, we discuss several strategies for mitigating various sources of crosstalk.

Abstract:
Extremal non-signaling (ENS) boxes are correlations that correspond to vertices of the non-signaling polytope of a Bell scenario. Neither quantum theory nor any theory for ideal measurements allows for ENS boxes. That is, according to quantum theory, ENS boxes are nonphysical. Still, ENS boxes are crucial for addressing a number of problems in Bell nonlocality. Here, we obtain ENS boxes in arbitrary bipartite Bell scenarios and present the complete list of ENS boxes for several unexplored scenarios. Equipped with the boxes, we revisit several foundational questions. We find that already two copies of any ENS box violate the exclusivity (or local orthogonality) and Specker's principles. We provide the minimal decomposition of the magic square correlation - the simplest known perfect correlation in nature - in terms of ENS boxes. We identify the minimal scenario in which a dit of communication (with d < 6) is insufficient to simulate ENS boxes. Our results show that the ENS boxes approach leads to new results and opens new avenues for research.

Abstract:
A recent advancement in quantum computing shows a quantum advantage of certified randomness on the racetrack processor. This work investigates the execution efficiency of this architecture for general-purpose programs. We first explore the impact of increasing zones on runtime efficiency. Counterintuitively, our evaluations using variational programs reveal that expanding zones may degrade runtime performance under the existing scheduling policy. This degradation may be attributed to the increase in track length, which increases ion circulation overhead, offsetting the benefits of enhanced parallelism. To mitigate this, the proposed \textit{Plutarch} exploits 3 strategies: (i) unitary decomposition and translation to maximize zone utilization, (ii) prioritizing the execution of nearby gates over ion circulation, and (iii) implementing shortcuts to provide the alternative path.

Abstract:
This work presents an industrially scalable, power-efficient and high-performance quantum magnetometer chip based on proprietary 4H-silicon carbide (SiC) technology, leveraging wafer-scale fabrication techniques to optimize V2 silicon vacancy color centers for highly reproducible, industry-grade fabrication with precise control of depth and density. The integration of these color center ensembles into a planar silicon carbide waveguide enables efficient excitation of a large ensemble and simplifies fluorescence extraction compared to standard confocal methods. We report continuous-wave (CW) optically detected magnetic resonance measurements, complemented by Rabi, Ramsey, and Hahn-echo sequences, which demonstrate coherent capabilities of the large embedded ensemble of V2 centers. Based on the data, our device exhibits sensor shot-noise limited sensitivities 2-3 orders of magnitude lower compared to more complex confocal techniques. Collectively, these advancements simplify the quantum sensor architecture, enhance sensitivity, and streamline optical excitation and collection, thereby paving the way for the development of next-generation SiC-quantum sensing technologies.

Abstract:
Program obfuscation aims to conceal a program's internal structure while preserving its functionality. A central open problem is whether an obfuscation scheme for arbitrary quantum circuits exists. Despite several efforts having been made toward this goal, prior works have succeeded only in obfuscating quantum circuits that implement either pseudo-deterministic functions or unitary transformations. Although unitary transformations already include a broad class of quantum computation, many important quantum tasks, such as state preparation and quantum error-correction, go beyond unitaries and fall within general completely positive trace-preserving maps.   In this work, we construct the first quantum ideal obfuscation scheme for arbitrary quantum circuits that support quantum inputs and outputs in the classical oracle model assuming post-quantum one-way functions, thereby resolving an open problem posed in Bartusek et al. (STOC 2023), Bartusek, Brakerski, and Vaikuntanathan (STOC 2024), and Huang and Tang (FOCS 2025). At the core of our construction lies a novel primitive that we introduce, called the subspace-preserving strong pseudorandom unitary (spsPRU). An spsPRU is a family of efficient unitaries that fix every vector in a given linear subspace $S$, while acting as a Haar random unitary on the orthogonal complement $S^\perp$ under both forward and inverse oracle queries. Furthermore, by instantiating the classical oracle model with the ideal obfuscation scheme for classical circuits proposed by Jain et al. (CRYPTO 2023) and later enhanced by Bartusek et al. (arxiv:2510.05316), our obfuscation scheme can also be realized in the quantumly accessible pseudorandom oracle model.

Abstract:
We report on the observation of a new magic frequency within the hyperfine structure of the D2 line of ${}^{87}$Rb atoms at which the scattering of light into a high-finesse cavity is suppressed by an interplay between quantum interference and the strong collective coupling of atoms to the cavity. Scattering from a cloud of laser-driven cold atoms into the cavity was measured in a polarization sensitive way. We have found that both the Rayleigh and Raman scattering processes into the near-resonant cavity modes are extinguished at 185 MHz below the F=2$\leftrightarrow$F'=3 transition frequency. This coincidence together with the shape of the observed spectral dip imply that the effect relies on a quantum interference in the polariton excitations of the strongly coupled combined atom-photon system. We have also demonstrated the existence of a magic frequency around -506 MHz, where only the Raman scattering is suppressed due to a quantum interference effect at the single-atom level.

Abstract:
As qubit decoherence times are increased and readout technologies are improved, nonidealities in the drive signals, such as phase noise, are going to represent a growing limitation to the fidelity achievable at the end of complex control pulse sequencies. Here we study the impact on fidelity of phase noise affecting reference oscillators with the help of numerical simulations, which allow us to directly take into account the interaction between the phase fluctuations in the control signals and the evolution of the qubit state. Our method is based on the generation of phase noise realizations consistent with a given power spectral density, that are then applied to the pulse carrier in simulations, with Qiskit-Dynamics, of the qubit temporal evolution. By comparing the final state obtained at the end of a noisy pulse sequence with that in the ideal case and averaging over multiple noise realizations, we estimate the resulting degradation in fidelity, and exploiting an approximate analytical representation of a carrier affected by phase fluctuations, we discuss the contributions of the different spectral components of phase noise.

Abstract:
Exciton-polaritons are light-matter hybrid quasi-particles that have emerged as a flexible platform for developing quantum technologies and engineering material properties. However, the fundamental mechanistic principles that govern their dynamics and relaxation remain elusive. In this work, we provide the microscopic mechanistic understanding of the exciton-polariton relaxation process that follows from an excitation in the upper polariton. Using both mixed quantum-classical simulations and analytical analysis, we reveal that phonon-induced upper-to-lower polariton relaxation proceeds via two steps: the first step is a vertical inter-band transition from the upper to the lower polariton, which is followed by a second step that is a phonon-induced Fröhlich scattering within the lower polariton. We find that in materials of finite thickness (which include filled cavities), phonon-induced polaritonic intraband Fröhlich scattering is significantly suppressed. We show that the microscopic origin of this suppression is phonon-fluctuations synchronization (or self-averaging) due to the polaritonic spatial delocalization in the quantization direction. Finally, we show that the same phonon fluctuation-synchronization effect plays a central role across polaritonic relaxation pathways, and we derive simple analytical expressions that relate a material's finite thickness to the corresponding relaxation rate constants.

Abstract:
We propose a displacement-squeeze receiver (DSR) for discriminating BPSK displaced squeezed vacuum states (S-BPSK). The receiver applies a displacement followed by a squeezing operation with the squeezing axis rotated by $\fracπ{2}$, and performs photon-number-resolving detection with a MAP threshold decision. This processing effectively increases the distinguishability of the input states by elongating their distance in phase space and reducing their population overlap in Fock basis. We show that for all signal energy N, $P_\text{err}^\text{DSR} \in \left[P_\text{HB}^\text{DSS}, 2P_\text{HB}^\text{DSS}\right]$, under equal priors and ideal condition. In the low-energy regime, DSR beats the S-BPSK SQL at $N \approx 0.3$ and drops below the coherent-state BPSK (C-BPSK) Helstrom bound at $N \approx 0.4$, reaching $P_\text{err}^\text{DSR} < 1\%$ near $N \approx 0.6$. Finally, we quantify performance under non-unit efficiency and dark counts, phase diffusion, and receiver thermal noise, with MAP threshold adaptation providing robustness across these nonidealities.

We develop a data-driven framework for identifying non-Markovian dynamical equations of motion for open quantum systems. Starting from the Nakajima--Zwanzig formalism, we vectorize the reduced density matrix into a four-dimensional state vector and cast the dynamics as a Volterra integro-differential equation with an operator-valued memory kernel. The learning task is then formulated as a constrained optimization problem over the admissible operator space, where correlation functions are approximated by rational functions using Padé approximants. We establish well-posedness of the learnin

Abstract:
We present SASHMAG (Saturated Absorption Spectroscopy High-field MAGnetometer), an atomic sensor designed for precision magnetic-field measurements in the intermediate-to-high field regime ($>0.2\,\text{T}$) using Rubidium-87 ($^{87}Rb$). The sensor operates in the hyperfine Paschen-Back regime, where the hyperfine and Zeeman interactions decouple, and utilizes counter-propagating pump-probe configuration in Faraday geometry to resolve isolated, Doppler-free Zeeman transitions. To interpret the resulting spectra in this strongly field-dependent regime, we developed a comprehensive multilevel optical Bloch-equation model solved explicitly in the uncoupled $\ket{m_I, m_J}$ basis, capturing state mixing and nonlinear saturation dynamics. This model reproduces measured spectra at sub-Doppler resolution and is consistent with analytical expectations for power broadening and thermal Doppler scaling. Magnetic field estimation is performed using a physics-constrained optimization routine that infers the magnetic field by minimizing the residual between experimentally extracted line centers and calculated transition frequencies from the field-dependent Hamiltonian. We demonstrate magnetic field retrieval from $0.2\,\text{T}$ to $0.4\,\text{T}$ with a precision of $\pm 0.0017 \,\text{T}$). Furthermore, the validated simulation establishes a foundation for generating synthetic training datasets, paving the way for autonomous, Machine Learning-enhanced magnetometry in applications ranging from MRI to fusion reactors.

Abstract:
In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, distributed quantum computation has garnered considerable interest, as it overcomes the physical limitations of single-device architectures and enables scalable quantum information processing. In this study, we focus on the challenge of achieving exact amplitude amplification for quantum states with arbitrary amplitude distributions and subsequently propose a Distributed Exact Quantum Amplitude Amplification Algorithm (DEQAAA). Specifically, (1) it supports partitioning across any number of nodes $t$ within the range $2 \leq t \leq n$; (2) the maximum qubit count required for any single node is expressed as $\max \left(n_0,n_1,\dots,n_{t-1} \right) $, where $n_j$ represents the number of qubits at the $j$-th node, with $\sum_{j=0}^{t-1} n_j =n$; (3) it can realize exact amplitude amplification for multiple targets of a quantum state with arbitrary amplitude distributions; (4) we verify the effectiveness of DEQAAA by resolving a specific exact amplitude amplification task involving two targets (8 and 14 in decimal) via MindSpore Quantum, a quantum simulation software, with tests conducted on 4-qubit, 6-qubit, 8-qubit and 10-qubit systems. Notably, through the decomposition of $C^{n-1}PS$ gates, DEQAAA demonstrates remarkable advantages in both quantum gate count and circuit depth as the qubit number scales, thereby boosting its noise resilience. In the 10-qubit scenario, for instance, it achieves a reduction of over $97\%$ in both indicators compared to QAAA and EQAAA, underscoring its outstanding resource-saving performance.

Abstract:
High-rate concatenated quantum codes offer a promising pathway toward fault-tolerant quantum computation, yet designing efficient decoders that fully exploit their error-correction capability remains a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce a hard-decision decoder for concatenated quantum Hamming codes with time complexity polynomial in the block length. This decoder overcomes the limitations of conventional local decoding by leveraging higher-level syndrome information to revise lower-level recovery decisions -- a strategy we refer to as bidirectional decoding. For the concatenated $[[15,7,3]]$ quantum Hamming code under independent bit-flip noise, the bidirectional decoder improves the threshold from approximately $1.56\%$ to $4.35\%$ compared with standard local decoding. Moreover, the decoder empirically preserves the full $3^{L}$ code-distance scaling for at least three levels of concatenation, resulting in substantially faster logical-error suppression than the $2^{L+1}$ scaling offered by local decoders. Our results can enhance the competitiveness of concatenated-code architectures for low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation.

Abstract:
A quantum Latin square of order $n$ (denoted as QLS$(n)$) is an $n\times n$ array whose entries are unit column vectors from the $n$-dimensional Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_n$, such that each row and column forms an orthonormal basis. Two unit vectors $|u\rangle, |v\rangle\in \mathcal{H}_n$ are regarded as identical if there exists a real number $θ$ such that $|u\rangle=e^{iθ}|v\rangle$; otherwise, they are considered distinct. The cardinality $c$ of a QLS$(n)$ is the number of distinct vectors in the array. In this note,we use sub-QLS$(6)$ to prove that for any integer $m\geq 2$ and any $c\in [6m,36m^2]\setminus \{6m+1\}$, there is a QLS$(6m)$ with cardinality $c$.

Abstract:
An initial value algorithm is utilized to examine the time dependent evolution of the electromagnetic fields arising from oblique scattering of bounded pulses from an infinite planar dielectric interface. Since the qubit lattice algorithm (QLA) is almost fully unitary, one finds excellent conservation of electromagnetic energy. Various Gaussian envelope pulses are considered in regimes where the incident angle is below that needed for total internal reflection. While the reflected pulse retains its overall Gaussian shape, the transmitted pulse exhibits a combination of a Gaussian envelope along with Huygen-like emitted wave fronts from the collision point of the initial pulse with the infinite dielectric interface. The strength of these Huygen wavefronts depends on the width of the incident pulse.

Abstract:
We develop a unified many-body theory of two-photon dark-state laser cooling, the workhorse for preparing trapped ions close to their motional quantum ground state. For ions with a $Λ$ level structure, driven by Raman lasers, we identify an ion-number-dependent crossover between weak and strong coupling where both the cooling rate and final temperature are simultaneously optimized. We obtain simple analytic results in both extremes: In the weak coupling limit, we show a Lorentzian spin-absorption spectrum determines the cooling rate and final occupation of the motional state, which are both independent of the number of ions. We also highlight the benefit of including an additional spin dependent force in this case. In the strong coupling regime, our theory reveals the role of collective dynamics arising from phonon exchange between dark and bright states, allowing us to explain the enhancement of the cooling rate with increasing ion number. Our analytic results agree closely with exact numerical simulations and provide experimentally accessible guidelines for optimizing cooling in large ion crystals, a key step toward scalable, high-fidelity trapped-ion quantum technologies.

Abstract:
Nonlocality is a peculiar nature of quanta and it stands as an important quantum resource in application. Yet mere linear property of it, viz. the first order in moment, has been explored through various inequalities. Noticing the vast higher-order regime unexplored, in this study we investigate the higher-order quantum correlations in entangled hyperon-antihyperon system, which may be generated massively in charmonium decays. A new type of Clauser-Horne inequality for statistical cumulants and central moments is formulated. We find that a significant violation of the third-order constraint, indicating the existence of higher-order correlation, exists in hyperon-antihyperon system and can be observed in high energy physics experiments, like BESIII and Belle II. Notably, the violation manifests more in higher energy systems of the $Λ\barΛ$ pair against the kinematic contamination of timelike events.

Abstract:
Scale invariance in quantum mechanics can be broken in several ways. A well-known example is the breakdown of continuous scale invariance to discrete scale invariance, whose typical realization is the Efimov effect of three-body problems. Here we discuss yet another discrete symmetry to which continuous scale invariance can be broken: discrete phase invariance. We first revisit the one-body problem on the half line in the presence of an inverse-square potential -- the simplest example of nontrivial scale-invariant quantum mechanics -- and show that continuous scale invariance can be broken to discrete phase invariance in a small window of coupling constant. We also show that discrete phase invariance manifests itself as circularly distributed simple poles on Riemann sheets of the S-matrix. We then present three examples of few-body problems that exhibit discrete phase invariance. These examples are the one-body Aharonov-Bohm problem, a two-body problem of nonidentical particles in two dimensions, and a three-body problem of nonidentical particles in one dimension, all of which contain a codimension-two ``magnetic'' flux in configuration spaces.

Abstract:
We propose a geometric hybrid Poincaré sphere (GHPS) as a unified geometrical framework for describing structured photon states with independently controllable spin angular momentum (SAM) and orbital angular momentum (OAM). Unlike the conventional higher-order Poincaré sphere, in which the SAM and OAM are intrinsically coupled through fixed basis states, the GHPS is constructed by defining its poles as direct products of arbitrary orthogonal bases on the Poincaré sphere (PS) and orbital Poincaré sphere (OPS) and by superposing these pole states. Using numerical simulations, we analyze representative GHPS states and show that the GHPS spherical coordinates govern the amplitude ratio and relative phase between the pole bases. This framework enables spatially inhomogeneous polarization distributions and intensity patterns, including nonseparable structures in which polarization and intensity are intrinsically intertwined, and provides a systematic state-space description for the coherent geometrical control of advanced structured light fields.

Abstract:
The generalized quantum Arimoto--Blahut (QAB) algorithm is a powerful derivative-free iterative method in quantum information theory. A key obstacle to its broader use is that existing convergence guarantees typically rely on analytical conditions that are either overly restrictive or difficult to verify for concrete problems. We address this issue by introducing an a posteriori certification viewpoint: instead of requiring fully a priori verifiable assumptions, we provide convergence and error guarantees that can be validated directly from the iterates produced by the algorithm. Specifically, we prove a generalized global convergence theorem showing that, under convexity and a substantially weaker numerically verifiable condition, the QAB iteration converges to the global minimizer. This theorem yields a practical certification procedure: by checking explicit inequalities along the computed trajectory, one can certify global optimality and bound the suboptimality of the obtained value. As an application, we develop a certified iterative scheme for computing the quantum relative entropy of channels, a fundamental measure of distinguishability in quantum dynamics. This quantity is notoriously challenging to evaluate numerically: gradient-based methods are impeded by the complexity of matrix functions such as square roots and logarithms, while recent semidefinite programming approaches can become computationally and memory intensive at high precision. Our method avoids these bottlenecks by combining the QAB iteration with a posteriori certification, yielding an efficient and scalable algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate rapid convergence and improved scalability and adaptivity compared with SDP-based approaches.

Abstract:
We study the CHSH inequality from an informational, timing-sensitive viewpoint using game-theoretic probability, which avoids assuming an underlying probability space. The locality loophole and the measurement-dependence (``freedom-of-choice'') loophole are reformulated as structural constraints in a sequential hidden-variable game between Scientists and Nature. We construct a loopholes-closed game with capital processes that test (i) convergence of empirical conditional frequencies to the CHSH correlations and (ii) the absence of systematic correlations between measurement settings and Nature's hidden-variable assignments, and prove that Nature cannot satisfy both simultaneously: at least one capital process must diverge. This yields an operational winning strategy for Scientists and a game-theoretic probabilistic interpretation of experimentally observed CHSH violations.

Abstract:
The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis explains thermalization in isolated quantum systems through the statistical properties of observables in the energy eigenbasis. We investigate the crossover from integrability to chaos in the spin-$1/2$ XXZ chain, establishing a direct correspondence between the spectral correlations of the Hamiltonian and local observables expressed in the energy eigenbasis as a signature of ergodicity breaking. By introducing a local perturbation that drives the system from integrability to chaos, we track the standard ETH indicators and the eigenstate entanglement entropy. We introduce a submatrix-based framework for analyzing local observables in the energy eigenbasis. By extracting real-symmetric blocks along the diagonal of the local observables represented in eigenbasis, we show that these submatrices exhibit both the short-range and long-range spectral features of the Hamiltonian. Remarkably, this correspondence persists even in a partially ergodic regime, indicating that the emergence of chaos is already encoded locally within the observables' matrix structure and that small blocks are sufficient to capture the underlying spectral correlations.

Abstract:
Coherent multidimensional spectroscopy enables detailed investigations of vibronic effects in molecular and solid-state systems. We present explicit analytical expressions for multidimensional nonlinear response functions in the presence of Herzberg-Teller (non-Condon) coupling, within the displaced harmonic oscillator model. The formulation applies to electronic systems with an arbitrary number N of electronic states and to response functions of arbitrary order M in the light-matter interaction. We show that Herzberg-Teller coupling introduces additional oscillatory factors in the time-domain response functions, leading, upon Fourier transformation, to replicas of the Franck-Condon multidimensional spectra shifted by integer multiples of the vibrational frequencies. The present results provide a general analytical framework for the interpretation of non-Condon effects in coherent multidimensional spectroscopies.

Abstract:
One of the key considerations in the development of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) protocols is the encoding of classical data onto a quantum device. In this chapter we introduce the Matrix Product State representation of quantum systems and show how it may be used to construct circuits which encode a desired state. Putting this in the context of QML we show how this process may be modified to give a low depth approximate encoding and crucially that this encoding does not hinder classification accuracy and is indeed exhibits an increased robustness against classical adversarial attacks. This is illustrated by demonstrations of adversarially robust variational quantum classifiers for the MNIST and FMNIST dataset, as well as a small-scale experimental demonstration on a superconducting quantum device.

Abstract:
In fault-tolerant quantum computing, a large number of physical qubits are required to construct a single logical qubit, and a single quantum node may be able to hold only a small number of logical qubits. In such a case, the idea of distributed fault-tolerant quantum computing (DFTQC) is important to demonstrate large-scale quantum computation using small-scale nodes. However, the design of distributed systems on small-scale nodes, where each node can store only one or a few logical qubits for computation, has not been explored well yet. In this paper, we propose network-based quantum computation (NBQC) to efficiently realize distributed fault-tolerant quantum computation using many small-scale nodes. A key idea of NBQC is to let computational data continuously move throughout the network while maintaining the connectivity to other nodes. We numerically show that, for practical benchmark tasks, our method achieves shorter execution times than circuit-based strategies and more node-efficient constructions than measurement-based quantum computing. Also, if we are allowed to specialize the network to the structure of quantum programs, such as peak access frequencies, the number of nodes can be significantly reduced. Thus, our methods provide a foundation in designing DFTQC architecture exploiting the redundancy of many small fault-tolerant nodes.

Abstract:
The preparation of quantum states is one of the most fundamental tasks in quantum computing, and a key primitive in many quantum algorithms. Of particular interest to areas such as quantum simulation and linear-system solvers are sparse quantum states, which contain only a small number $s$ of non-zero computational basis states compared to a generic state. In this work, we present an approach that prepares $s$-sparse states on $n$ qubits, reducing the number of Toffoli gates required compared to prior art. We work in the established framework of first preparing a dense state on a $\lceil{\log(s)}\rceil$-qubit sub-register, and then mapping this state to the target state via an isometry, with the latter step dominating the cost of the full algorithm. The speed-up is achieved by designing an efficient algorithm for finding and implementing the isometry. The worst-case Toffoli cost of our isometry circuit, which may be viewed as a batched version of an approach by Malvetti et al., is essentially $2s$ for sufficiently large values of $n$, yielding roughly a $\log(s)/2$ improvement factor over the state-of-the-art. In numerical benchmarks on randomly chosen states, the cost is closer to $s$. With the improved isometry circuit, we examine the dense-state preparation step and present ways to optimize the joint cost of both steps, particularly in the case of target states with purely real coefficients, by outsourcing some sub-tasks from the dense-state preparation to the isometry.

Abstract:
The open quantum Rabi model is studied in this work, with the explicit $\mathbf{A}^{2}$ term incorporated as required by the Thomas-Reich-Kuhn sum rule. It is shown that anisotropy provides a generic and robust mechanism for overcoming the no-go theorem in dissipative quantum systems, thereby establishing a genuine platform for observing dissipative phase transitions. The inclusion of the $\mathbf{A}^{2}$ term yields a significantly richer and asymmetric steady-state phase diagram, consisting of normal, superradiant, and bistable phases that intersect at tricritical points, while isolated bistable phases also emerge and the number of tricritical points is reduced. Notably, it is near the intersection of the two critical-line branches enclosing the superradiant phases, rather than at the tricritical points, that the $\mathbf{A}^{2}$ term fundamentally alters the scaling of photon-number fluctuations. Given the inherent role of the $\mathbf{A}^{2}$ term in light-matter interactions, our findings open a realistic route toward the experimental investigation and dynamical control of nonequilibrium critical phenomena in practical open quantum platforms.

Abstract:
Non-Gaussian mechanical states are a key resource for quantum-enhanced sensing and tests of macroscopic quantum physics. We propose a measurement-based protocol to herald delocalized, nonclassical states of a mechanical oscillator in cavity optomechanics by conditioning on Geiger photodetection of the optical output. We analyse under which conditions Stokes-induced optomechanical entanglement give rise to mechanical Wigner Function negativity upon detection. We develop and compare a blue-detuned pulsed scheme and a continuous-wave steady-state scheme employing temporal-mode filtering, and we quantify heralding rates and robustness to finite temperature under realistic detection efficiencies.

Abstract:
We investigated the spectral properties of squeezed light generated via parametric down-conversion in the high-gain regime, considering both unapodized and apodized dispersion-engineered waveguides. The gain-dependent evolution of these states is examined starting from the low-gain regime, which includes both highly correlated and nearly uncorrelated cases. For the unapodized configuration, we observe a monotonic increase in spectral purity with gain, whereas the apodized configuration exhibits a nonmonotonic dependence, initially decreasing and then recovering at higher gain. By combining Schmidt-mode analysis with a group-velocity-based interpretation, we explain why different dispersion conditions exhibit distinct gain-dependent behavior, specifically that rapid purification occurs when the pump group velocity lies between those of the signal and idler. Our study shows that the evolution of spectral purity is governed primarily by the underlying dispersion of the waveguide. These results demonstrate that dispersion engineering and parametric gain can be jointly exploited to tailor the spectral-mode structure of squeezed-light sources, enabling their optimization for a broad range of quantum applications.

We present an analytically tractable theory of reservoir-engineered refrigeration of a superconducting microwave cavity and map it onto a realistic solid-state implementation based on gate-defined double-quantum-dot (DQD) spin qubits. Treating the DQD not as a spectroscopic element but as a tunable engineered reservoir, we show how gate control of populations, coherences, linewidths, and detuning defines an effective photon birth-death process with predictable detailed balance. This framework yields closed-form expressions for the cavity steady state, identifies cooling bounds and detuning-dependent refrigeration valleys, and clarifies when refrigeration can drive the cavity below both the bath temperature and the DQD setpoint. By distinguishing refreshed (collision-like) and persistent reservoir regimes, we show how memory effects, saturation, and dark-state formation constrain cooling in realistic devices, while collective bright-mode coupling in a two-dot configuration can enhance refrigeration subject to mismatch and dephasing, as confirmed by numerical Lindblad simulations demonstrating targeted millikelvin cavity cooling relevant for cryogenic circuit-QED architectures.

Abstract:
This book gives a geometry-first, hardware-aware route through quantum-information workflows, with one goal: connect states, circuits, and measurement to deterministic classical pipelines that make hybrid quantum systems run. Part 1 develops the backbone (essential linear algebra, the Bloch-sphere viewpoint, differential-geometric intuition, and quantum Fisher information geometry) so evolution can be read as motion on curved spaces and measurement as statistics. Part 2 reframes circuits as dataflow graphs: measurement outcomes are parsed, aggregated, and reduced to small linear-algebra updates that schedule the next pulses, highlighting why low-latency, low-jitter streaming matters. Part 3 treats multi-qubit structure and entanglement as geometry and computation, including teleportation, superdense coding, entanglement detection, and Shor's algorithm via quantum phase estimation. Part 4 focuses on topological error correction and real-time decoding (Track A): stabilizer codes, surface-code decoding as "topology -> graph -> algorithm", and Union-Find decoders down to microarchitectural/RTL constraints, with verification, fault injection, and host/control-stack integration under product metrics (bounded latency, p99 tails, fail-closed policies, observability). Optional Track C covers quantum cryptography and streaming post-processing (BB84/E91, QBER/abort rules, privacy amplification, and zero-knowledge/post-quantum themes), emphasizing FSMs, counters, and hash pipelines. Appendices provide visualization-driven iCEstick labs (switch-to-bit conditioning, fixed-point phase arithmetic, FSM sequencing, minimal control ISAs), bridging principles to implementable systems.

Abstract:
We introduce the genuine multipartite Rains entanglement (GMRE) as a measure of genuine multipartite entanglement that can be computed using semi-definite programming. Similar to the Rains relative entropy (its bipartite counterpart), the GMRE is monotone under selective quantum operations that completely preserve the positivity of the partial transpose, implying that it is a multipartite entanglement monotone. As a consequence, we show that the GMRE bounds both the one-shot standard and probabilistic approximate GHZ-distillable entanglement from above. We also develop a generalization of this quantity that incorporates other entropies, including quantum Renyi relative entropies.

Abstract:
Highly multipartite entangled states play an important role in various quantum computing tasks. We investigate the dissipative generation of a complex entanglement structure as in a cluster state through engineered Markovian dynamics in the spin systems coupled via Ising interactions. Using the Lindblad master equation, we design a projection based dissipative channel that drives the system toward a unique pure steady state corresponding to the desired cluster state. This is done by removing the contribution of the orthogonal states. By explicitly constructing the Liouvillian superoperator in the full $2^N$-dimensional Hilbert space, we compute the steady-state density matrix, the Liouvillian spectral gap, entanglement witness and the fidelity with respect to the ideal cluster state. The results demonstrate that the cluster state emerges as the steady state when the engineered Liouvillian dissipation dominates over the local Ising interaction between spins. Moreover, we find that the fidelity and Liouvillian spectral gap is relatively insensitive to the system size once the saturation dissipation has been achieved that scales linearly with the qubit number. This analysis illustrates a physically realizable path towards steady-state entanglement generation in the spin systems using engineered dissipation.

Abstract:
Molecular spins are promising candidates for quantum information science, leveraging coherent electronic spin states for quantum sensing and computation. However, the practical application of these systems is hindered by electronic spin decoherence, driven by interactions with nuclear spins in the molecule and the surrounding environment at low temperatures. Predicting dephasing dynamics remains a formidable challenge due to the complexity of the spin bath. In this work, we develop a non-Markovian time-convolutionless master equation to treat an electronic spin coupled to a nuclear-spin bath. By relating ab initio electronic structure parameters directly to the decoherence dynamics, we provide a framework that accounts for pure dephasing in the low-temperature limit. We apply this method to a series of molecular qubit candidates and demonstrate good agreement with experimental relaxation trends. This approach offers a computationally efficient path for the prediction of low-temperature decoherence trends in molecular spin systems.

Abstract:
The generation of non-Gaussian quantum states is a key requirement for universal continuous-variable quantum information processing. We report the experimental generation of large-amplitude squeezed coherent-state superpositions (squeezed cat states) on free-space optical pulses, reaching an amplitude of $α= 2.47$, which, to our knowledge, exceeds all previously reported values. Our protocol relies on the controlled mixing of the Fock states $|1\rangle$ and $|2\rangle$ through a tunable beam splitter, followed by heralding via homodyne detection. The resulting state displays three well-resolved negative regions in its Wigner function and achieves a fidelity of $0.53$ with the target state $\propto \hat{S}(z)(|α\rangle - |-α\rangle)$, with $α= 2.47$ and squeezing parameter $z = 0.56$. These results constitute a significant milestone for temporal breeding protocols and for the iterative generation of optical GKP states, opening new perspectives for scalable and fault-tolerant photonic quantum architectures.

Abstract:
We introduce a category $\mathsf{qGph}$ of quantum graphs, whose definition is motivated entirely from noncommutative geometry. For all quantum graphs $G$ and $H$ in $\mathsf{qGph}$, we then construct a quantum graph $[G,H]$ of homomorphisms from $G$ to $H$, making $\mathsf{qGph}$ a closed symmetric monoidal category. We prove that for all finite graphs $G$ and $H$, the quantum graph $[G,H]$ is nonempty iff the $(G,H)$-homomorphism game has a winning quantum strategy, directly generalizing the classical case.   The finite quantum graphs in $\mathsf{qGph}$ are tracial, real, and self-adjoint, and the morphisms between them are CP morphisms that are adjoint to a unital $*$-homomorphism. We show that Weaver's two notions of a CP morphism coincide in this context. We also show that every finite reflexive quantum graph is the confusability quantum graph of a quantum channel, answering a question of Daws.

Abstract:
Bivariate bicycle (BB) codes are a prominent class of quantum LDPC codes constructed from group algebras. While the logical dimension and quantum distance of \emph{coprime} BB codes are known to be determined by a greatest common divisor polynomial $g(z)$, the properties governing their fault tolerance under noisy measurement have remained implicit. In this work, we prove that this same polynomial $g(z)$ dictates the code's stabilizer redundancy and the structure of the classical \emph{syndrome codes} required for single-shot decoding. We derive a strict equality between the quantum rate and the stabilizer redundancy density, and we provide BCH-like bounds on the achievable single-shot measurement error tolerance. Guided by this framework, we construct small coprime BB codes with significantly improved syndrome distance ($d_S$) and evaluate them using BP+OSD. Our analysis reveals a structural bottleneck: within the coprime BB ansatz, high quantum rate imposes an upper bound on syndrome distance, limiting single-shot performance. These results provide concrete algebraic design rules for next-generation 2BGA codes in measurement-limited architectures.

Abstract:
We study directionally informed belief propagation (BP) decoding for quantum CSS codes, where anisotropic Tanner-graph structure and biased noise concentrate degeneracy along preferred directions. We formalize this by placing orientation weights on Tanner-graph edges, aggregating them into per-qubit directional weights, and defining a \emph{directional degeneracy enumerator} that summarizes how degeneracy concentrates along those directions. A single bias parameter~$β$ maps these weights into site-dependent log-likelihood ratios (LLRs), yielding anisotropic priors that plug directly into standard BP$\rightarrow$OSD decoders without changing the code construction. We derive bounds relating directional and Hamming distances, upper bound the number of degenerate error classes per syndrome as a function of distance, rate, and directional bias, and give a MacWilliams-type expression for the directional enumerator. Finite-length simulations under code-capacity noise show significant logical error-rate reductions -- often an order of magnitude at moderate physical error rates -- confirming that modest anisotropy is a simple and effective route to hardware-aware decoding gains.

Abstract:
Time-periodic modulation of a static system is a powerful method for realizing robust unidirectional topological states. So far, all such realizations have been based on interactions among $s$ orbitals, without incorporating inter-orbital couplings. Here, we demonstrate higher-orbital Floquet topological insulators by introducing periodically modulated couplings between the optical $s$ and $p$ orbitals in a square lattice. The staggered phase of the $s$-$p$ couplings gives rise to a synthetic uniform $π$ magnetic flux per plaquette of the lattice, and periodic driving of the couplings opens a topological bandgap, characterized by the Floquet winding number. We image topological edge modes of $s$-$p$ orbitals traveling unidirectionally around a corner. Here, the topological phases are realized by a combined effect of the periodic driving and synthetic magnetic flux. Consequently, when the synthetic flux is turned off, the system becomes trivial over a range of driving parameters. Our results open a promising pathway for exploring topological phenomena by introducing the orbital degree of freedom.

Abstract:
Neutral-atom quantum simulators provide a powerful platform for realizing strongly correlated phases, enabling access to dynamical signatures of quasiparticles and symmetry breaking processes. Motivated by recent observations of quantum phases in flux-frustrated ladders with non-vanishing ground state currents, we investigate interacting bosons on the dimerized BBH lattice in two dimensions-originally introduced in the context of higher-order topology. After mapping out the phase diagram, which includes vortex superfluid (V-SF), vortex Mott insulator (V-MI), and featureless Mott insulator (MI) phases, we focus on the integer filling case. There, the MI/V-SF transition simultaneously breaks the $\mathbb Z_2^{T}$ and U(1) symmetries, where $\mathbb Z_2^{T}$ corresponds to time-reversal symmetry (TRS). Using a slave-boson description, we resolve the excitation spectrum across the transition and uncover a chiral Higgs mode whose mass softens at criticality, providing a dynamical hallmark of emergent chirality that we numerically probe via quench dynamics. Our results establish an experimentally realistic setting for probing unconventional TRS-broken phases and quasiparticles with intrinsic chirality in strongly interacting quantum matter.

Abstract:
We present a rigorous analysis that combines theory, simulation, and experimental measurements to quantify the relationship between strain and bandgap in two dimensional gallium selenide (Ga$_2$Se$_2$). Experimentally, we transfer thin Ga$_2$Se$_2$ flakes onto patterned substrates to deterministically induce multiaxial localized strain. We quantify the local strain using a combination of atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements and COMSOL Multiphysics simulation. We then experimentally map the strain-induced bandgap shifts using high-resolution hyperspectral PL imaging to generate a robust and statistically significant dataset. We systematically fit this data to extract gauge factors that relate the bandgap shift to the local uniaxial and biaxial strain. We then compute the uniaxial and biaxial strain gauge factors via density functional theory (DFT) and find excellent agreement with the experimentally-determined values. Finally, we show that a simple model that computes bandgap shifts from the local uniaxial and biaxial strain predicts the observed multiaxial bandgap shift with less than 10\% error. The combined results provide a framework for deterministic realization of tailored bandgap profiles induced by controlled strain applied to Ga$_2$Se$_2$, with implications for the future realization of localized quantum emitters for quantum photonic applications.

Abstract:
We investigate the complex time evolution of a vacuum state with the insertion of a local primary operator in two-dimensional conformal field theories (2d CFTs). This complex time evolution can be considered as a composite process constructed from Lorentzian time evolution and a Euclidean evolution induced by a post-selected measurement. Our main finding is that in the spatially-compact system, this complex time evolution drives the state of the subsystems to those of the primary state with the same conformal dimensions of the inserted operator. Contrary to the compact system, the subsystems of the spatially non-compact system evolve to states that depend on the non-unitary process during a certain time regime. In holographic systems with a compact spatial direction, this process induced by a heavy local operator can correspond to the relaxation from a black hole with an inhomogeneous horizon to that with a uniform one, while in the ones with a non-compact spatial direction, it can correspond to the relaxation to that with a horizon depending on the non-unitary process.

Our formalism avoids the sums over intermediate states and yield directly corrections to the energy and eigenstates in terms of integrals weighted by the probability densities for the edge states of the involved supersymmetric Hamiltonians.

Abstract:
Modern understanding of symmetry in quantum field theory includes both invertible and non-invertible operations. Motivated by this, we extend Nielsen's geometric approach to quantum circuit complexity to incorporate non-invertible gates. These arise naturally from fusion of topological defects and allow transitions between superselection sectors. We realise fusion operations as completely positive, trace-preserving quantum channels. Including such gates makes the sector-changing optimisation problem discrete: it reduces to a weighted shortest-path problem on the fusion graph. Circuit complexity therefore combines continuous geometry within sectors with discrete sector jumps. We illustrate the framework in rational conformal field theories and briefly comment on an AdS$_3$ interpretation in which fusion-induced transitions correspond to geometry-changing boundary operations. A companion paper provides full derivations and extended examples.

Abstract:
We investigate the quantum properties of heavy-fermion pairs, such as $t\bar t$ or $τ^+τ^-$, produced in lepton-lepton collisions with polarised beams. Focusing on spin correlations, entanglement, Bell-inequality violation, and quantum-information--theoretic measures such as purity and magic, we analyse how beam polarisation shapes the structure of the spin-density matrix. We derive analytic expressions for a wide range of helicity configurations, including both Standard Model contributions and generic new-physics effects parametrised by scalar, vector, and tensor four-fermion operators within an effective field theory framework. We show that beam polarisation unlocks a substantially richer set of spin configurations and significantly enhances sensitivity to non-standard interactions. As a phenomenological application, we study $t\bar t$ production at a future linear collider and demonstrate that quantum observables provide a comprehensive and complementary probe of top-quark interactions and stronger constraints on the scale of new physics.

Abstract:
The Berry phase, a fundamental geometric phase in quantum systems, has become a crucial tool for probing the topological properties of materials. Quantum oscillations, such as Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations, are widely used to extract this phase, but its unambiguous determination remains challenging. This work highlights the inherent ambiguities in interpreting the oscillation phase solely from SdH data, primarily due to the influence of the spin factor $R_S$, which depends on the Landé $g$-factor and effective mass. While the Lifshitz-Kosevich (LK) theory provides a framework for analyzing oscillations, the unknown g-factor introduces significant uncertainty. For instance, a zero oscillation phase could arise either from a nontrivial Berry phase or a negative $R_S$. We demonstrate that neglecting $R_S$ in modern studies, especially for topological materials with strong spin-orbit coupling, can lead to doubtful conclusions. Through theoretical analysis and numerical examples, we show how the interplay between the Berry phase and Zeeman effect complicates phase determination. Additionally, we also discuss another underappreciated mechanism - the magnetic field dependence of the Fermi level. Our discussion underscores the need for complementary experimental techniques to resolve these ambiguities and calls for further research to refine the interpretation of quantum oscillations in topological systems.

Abstract:
We extend a recently developed "tangent fermion" method to discretize the Hamiltonian of a helical Luttinger liquid on a one-dimensional lattice, including two-particle backscattering processes that may open a gap in the spectrum. The fermion-doubling obstruction of the sine dispersion is avoided by working with a tangent dispersion, preserving the time-reversal symmetry of the Hamiltonian. The numerical results from a tensor network calculation on a finite lattice confirm the expectation from infinite-system analytics, that a gapped phase with spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry emerges when the Fermi level is tuned to the Dirac point and the Luttinger parameter crosses a critical value.

Abstract:
Compared to other stable isotopes of $\rm{Yb}^+$, $^{173}\rm{Yb}^+$ has a richer hyperfine structure, which leads to more favorable clock transitions, spectroscopic techniques for probing new physics, and more sophisticated quantum computing architectures. However, to date, its electronic spectrum remains poorly characterized. Here, we report on efficient laser cooling, state preparation, and detection of a single trapped $^{173}\rm{Yb}^+$ ion. The previously unobserved $^2\!S_{1/2} \rightarrow {}^2\!D_{3/2}$ electric quadrupole transition at 436 nm is coherently excited, and the isotope shift between $^{171}\rm{Yb}^+$ and $^{173}\rm{Yb}^+$ on this transition is determined with an uncertainty of 1.4 Hz. Using microwave spectroscopy, we resolve the hyperfine structure (HFS) of the ${}^2\!D_{3/2}$ state with a relative uncertainty below $10^{-8}$. From the HFS measurement data, we infer for ${}^{173}$Yb a nuclear magnetic octupole moment $Ω= -0.062(8)\,({\rm b} \times μ_N)$ with uncertainty reduced by more than 2 orders of magnitude compared to previous studies. The data also allow us to determine hyperfine anomalies for the ${}^2\!S_{1/2}$ and ${}^2\!D_{3/2}$ states.

Abstract:
We explore the existence and stability of exceptional points (EPs) in finite waveguide arrays subject to single-site dissipation. We show that the EP landscape is dictated by a geometry-dependent parity effect, leading to strictly distinct spectral behaviors for arrays with even versus odd numbers of waveguides. Through analytical derivation and numerical analysis, we define the conditions under which these singularities emerge and evolve. Our findings clarify the mechanisms of symmetry breaking in finite non-Hermitian lattices, offering new guidelines for the design of robust optical structures that exploit or avoid exceptional points.

Abstract:
We present the electro-thermal characterization of transition-edge sensor (TES) detectors suspended on Si membranes fabricated using a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer. The use of an all-silicon fabrication platform, in contrast to the more commonly used silicon nitride membranes, is compatible with monolithic fabrication of integrated TES and SQUID circuits. The all-silicon architecture additionally allows efficient use of focal plane area; the readout circuitry may be positioned out of the focal plane by bending a thinned portion of the chip. Compatibility with integrated fabrication and efficient use of focal plane area provide a path to an efficient soft X-ray spectrometer.   This work is motivated by our goal to develop a 10,000-pixel TES spectrometer to overcome critical measurement limitations in catalysis research. The characterization of fragile, carbon-based intermediates via techniques like Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) is often precluded by the slow, high-flux nature of existing technologies. The new instrument will allow for fast RIXS measurements to be made without causing sample damage. We verify the detector models and measure the energy resolution using a pulsed optical laser, demonstrating the viability of this approach for the final instrument to be deployed at the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II).

Abstract:
We propose a mechanism for the inverse Faraday and the inverse Cotton--Mouton effects arising from quantum geometry, characterized by the quantum metric quadrupole and the weighted quantum metric. Within a semiclassical framework based on the Boltzmann transport theory, we establish a general formalism describing light-induced magnetization in electronic systems as a second-order response to the electric field of light. Using continuum and tight-binding models, we discuss the symmetry constraints on these effects and estimate the magnitudes of the resulting magnetizations. Our results highlight a direct manifestation of quantum-geometric quantities in nonlinear magneto-optical responses and suggest a viable pathway for experimental detection.

Abstract:
There is a tremendous interest in fabricating superconducting flux circuits that are nonstoquastic -- i.e., have positive off-diagonal matrix elements -- in their qubit representation, as these circuits are thought to be unsimulable by classical approaches due to the presence of a sign problem and thus could play a key role in the demonstration of speedups in quantum annealing protocols. We show, however, that the elimination of the sign problem in these systems is possible by the direct simulation of the flux circuits. Our approach not only obviates the reduction of flux circuits to their qubit representation but also produces results that are more in the spirit of the experimental setup. We discuss the implications of our work, arguing that our findings cast doubt on the conception that superconducting flux circuits represent the correct avenue for universal adiabatic quantum computers.

Abstract:
Transformations of transformations, also called higher-order transformations, is a natural concept in information processing, which has recently attracted significant interest in the study of quantum causal relations. In this work, a framework for characterizing higher-order quantum transformations which relies on the use of superoperator projectors is presented. More precisely, working with projectors in the Choi-Jamiolkowski picture is shown to provide a handy way of defining the characterization constraints on any class of higher-order transformations. The algebraic properties of these projectors are furthermore shown to obey rules similar to multiplicative additive linear logic (MALL), providing an intuitive way of comparing any two classes through their projectors. The main novelty of this work is the introduction to the algebra of the 'prec' connector. It is used for the characterization of maps that are no signaling from input to output or the other way around. This allows to assess the possible signaling structure of any transformation characterized within the projective framework. The properties of the prec are moreover shown to yield a normal form for projective expressions. This hints towards a general way to compare different classes of higher-order transformations.

Abstract:
Solving linear systems is of great importance in numerous fields. Proposed quantum algorithms for preparing solutions for linear systems include the HHL algorithm with subsequent refinements and variational methods. Circulant linear systems appear in many physics-related differential equations. An interesting case is banded circulant linear systems whose non-zero terms are within distance K of the main diagonal. For these systems, we propose an approach based on the classical combination of quantum states (CQS) method relying on convex optimization against the available analytical solution. From decompositions into cyclic permutations, the solution can be approximately represented by a classical combination of a polynomial number of quantum states. We validate our methods using classical simulations as well as execution on an IBM quantum computer. While in the setting of this paper, efficient classical algorithms are available, our results demonstrate the potential applicability of the CQS method for solving physics problems such as heat transfer.

Abstract:
Quantum algorithms typically demand prohibitively complicated circuits to solve practical problems. Previous studies have shown that classical randomness can accelerate some specific quantum algorithms. In this work, we introduce the Randomized Truncated Series (RTS) which extends this acceleration to all quantum algorithms that rely on truncated series approximations. RTS offers two key advantages: it quadratically suppresses truncation errors and allows for continuous adjustment of the effective truncation order. By leveraging random mixing between two quantum circuits, RTS ensures that their probabilistic combination accurately realizes the desired algorithm, while significantly reducing the average circuit size. We demonstrate the versatility of RTS through concrete applications. Our results shed light on the path toward practical quantum advantage.

Abstract:
Locality is a fundamental feature of many physical time evolutions. Assumptions on locality and related structural properties also underlie recently proposed procedures for learning an unknown Hamiltonian from access to the induced time evolution. However, no protocols to rigorously test whether an unknown Hamiltonian is local were known. We investigate Hamiltonian locality testing as a property testing problem, where the task is to determine whether an unknown $n$-qubit Hamiltonian $H$ is $k$-local or $\varepsilon$-far from all $k$-local Hamiltonians, given access to the time evolution along $H$. First, we emphasize the importance of the chosen distance measure: With respect to the operator norm, a worst-case distance measure, incoherent quantum locality testers require $\tildeΩ(2^n)$ many time evolution queries and an expected total evolution time of $\tildeΩ(2^n / \varepsilon)$, and even coherent testers need $Ω(2^{n/2})$ many queries and $Ω(2^{n/2}/\varepsilon)$ total evolution time. In contrast, when distances are measured according to the normalized Frobenius norm, corresponding to an average-case distance, we give a sample-, time-, and computationally efficient incoherent Hamiltonian locality testing algorithm based on randomized measurements. In fact, our procedure can be used to simultaneously test a wide class of Hamiltonian properties beyond locality. Finally, we prove that learning a general Hamiltonian remains exponentially hard with this average-case distance, thereby establishing an exponential separation between Hamiltonian testing and learning. Our work initiates the study of property testing for quantum Hamiltonians, demonstrating that a broad class of Hamiltonian properties is efficiently testable even with limited quantum capabilities, and positioning Hamiltonian testing as an independent area of research alongside Hamiltonian learning.

Abstract:
Combinatorial optimization problems that arise in science and industry typically have constraints. Yet the presence of constraints makes them challenging to tackle using both classical and quantum optimization algorithms. We propose a new quantum algorithm for constrained optimization, which we call quantum constrained Hamiltonian optimization (Q-CHOP). Our algorithm leverages the observation that for many problems, while the best solution is difficult to find, the worst feasible (constraint-satisfying) solution is known. The basic idea of Q-CHOP is to enforce a Hamiltonian constraint at all times, thereby restricting evolution to the subspace of feasible states, and slowly ``rotate'' an objective Hamiltonian to trace an adiabatic path from the worst feasible state to the best feasible state. Q-CHOP thereby assigns qualitatively distinct roles to the constraint and objective functions of a constrained optimization problem. We additionally propose a version of Q-CHOP that can start in any feasible state. Finally, we benchmark Q-CHOP against the commonly-used adiabatic algorithm of quantum annealing with an objective function that penalizes constraint violation, and find that Q-CHOP consistently performs significantly better on a wide range of problems, including textbook graph problems, knapsack problems, combinatorial auctions, and a real-world financial use case of bond exchange-traded fund basket optimization.

Abstract:
Many modern manufacturing companies have evolved from a single production facility to a multi-factory production environment that must manage both regionally dispersed production orders and their multi-site production steps. The availability of a range of machines in different locations capable of performing the same operation and shipping times between factories have transformed planning systems from the classic Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) to the Distributed Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (DFJSP). Consequently, the complexity of production planning has increased significantly. We employ Quantum Annealing (QA) to solve the DFJSP in our research. In addition to assigning production orders to production sites, production steps are also assigned to these sites. This requirement is based on a real use case of a wool textile manufacturing company. To investigate the applicability of this method to large problem instances, problems ranging from 50 variables up to 250 variables, the largest problem that could be embedded into a D-Wave quantum annealer Quantum Processing Unit (QPU), are formulated and solved. Special Attention is dedicated to determining the Lagrange parameters of the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model and the QPU configuration parameters, as these factors can significantly impact solution quality. The obtained solutions are compared to solutions obtained by Simulated Annealing (SA), both in terms of solution quality and calculation time. The results demonstrate that QA has the potential to solve large problem instances specific to the industry.

Abstract:
We propose a generalization of the graphical ZH calculus to qudits of prime-power dimensions $q = p^t$, implementing field arithmetic in arbitrary finite fields. This is an extension of a previous result by Roy which implemented arithmetic of prime-sized fields; and an alternative to a result by de Beaudrap which extended the ZH to implement cyclic ring arithmetic in $\mathbb Z / q\mathbb Z$ rather than field arithmetic in $\mathbb F_q$. We show this generalized ZH calculus to be universal over matrices $\mathbb C^{q^n} \to \mathbb C^{q^m}$ with entries in the ring $\mathbb Z[ω]$ where $ω$ is a $p$th root of unity. As an illustration of the necessity of such an extension of ZH for field rather than cyclic ring arithmetic, we offer a graphical description and proof for a quantum algorithm for polynomial interpolation. This algorithm relies on the invertibility of multiplication, and therefore can only be described in a graphical language that implements field, rather than ring, multiplication.

Abstract:
Erasure qubits offer a promising avenue toward reducing the overhead of quantum error correction (QEC) protocols. However, they require additional operations, such as erasure checks, that may add extra noise and increase runtime of QEC protocols. To assess the benefits provided by erasure qubits, we focus on the performance of the surface code as a quantum memory. In particular, we analyze various erasure check schedules, find the correctable regions in the phase space of error parameters and probe the subthreshold scaling of the logical error rate. We then consider a realization of erasure qubits in the superconducting hardware architectures via dual-rail qubits. We use the standard transmon-based implementation of the surface code as the performance benchmark. Our results indicate that QEC protocols with erasure qubits can outperform the ones with state-of-the-art transmons, even in the absence of precise information about the locations of erasure errors.

Abstract:
Light can be squeezed by reducing the quantum uncertainty of the electric field for some phases. We show how to use this purely quantum effect to extract net mechanical work from radiation pressure in a simple quantum photon engine. Along the way, we demonstrate that the standard definition of work in quantum systems does not capture the extractable mechanical work, as it does not reflect the energy leaked to these quantum degrees of freedom. We use these results to design an Otto engine able to produce mechanical work from squeezing baths, in the absence of a thermal gradient. Interestingly, while work extraction from squeezing generally improves for low temperatures, there exists a nontrivial squeezing-dependent temperature for which work production is maximal, demonstrating the complex interplay between thermal and squeezing effects.

Abstract:
We show that a highly-excited energy eigenfunction $ψ_{nlm}(\vec{r})$ of hydrogen atom can be approximated as an equal-weight superposition of classical elliptic orbits with energy $E_n$ and angular momentum $L=\sqrt{l(l+1)}\hbar$, and $z$ component of angular momentum $L_z=m\hbar$. This correspondence is established by comparing the quantum probability distribution $|ψ_{nlm}(\vec{r})|^2$ and the classical probability distribution $p_c(\vec{r})$ of an ensemble of such orbits. This finding illustrates a general principle: in the semi-classical limit, an energy eigenstate of a quantum system is in general reduced to a collection of classical orbits, rather than a single classical orbit.

Abstract:
As financial fraud becomes increasingly complex, effective detection methods are essential. Quantum Machine Learning (QML) introduces certain capabilities that may enhance both accuracy and efficiency in this area. This study examines how different quantum feature maps and ansatz configurations affect the performance of three QML-based classifiers, the Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC), the Sampler Quantum Neural Network (SQNN), and the Estimator Quantum Neural Network (EQNN), when applied to two non-normalized financial fraud datasets. Different quantum feature map and ansatz configurations are evaluated, revealing distinct performance patterns. The VQC consistently demonstrates strong classification results, achieving an F1-score of 0.88, while the SQNN also delivers promising outcomes. In contrast, the EQNN struggles to produce robust results, emphasizing the challenges presented by non-standardized data. Statistical validation using ANOVA confirms the significance of observed performance differences. Additionally, robustness tests on the best-performing models under five quantum noise types show that they maintain competitive performance, supporting their practical applicability. These findings highlight the importance of careful model configuration in QML-based financial fraud detection. By showing how specific feature maps and ansatz choices influence predictive success, this work guides researchers and practitioners in refining QML approaches for complex financial applications.

Abstract:
Interplay between quantum interference and classical randomness can enhance performance of various quantum information tasks. In the present paper we analyze recurrence phenomena in the discrete-time quantum stochastic walk on a line, which is a quantum stochastic process that interpolates between quantum and classical walk dynamics. Surprisingly, we find that introducing classical randomness can reduce the recurrence probability -- despite the fact that the classical random walk returns with certainty -- and we identify the conditions under which this intriguing phenomenon occurs. Numerical evaluation of the first-return generating function allows us to investigate the asymptotics of the return probability as the step number approaches infinity. This provides strong evidence that the suppression of recurrence probability is not a transient effect but a robust feature of the underlying quantum-classical interplay in the asymptotic limit. Our results show that for certain tasks discrete-time quantum stochastic walks outperform both classical random walks and unitary quantum walks.

Abstract:
Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides information-theoretic security grounded in the fundamental laws of physics. Nevertheless, practical imperfections can introduce side channels that expose QKD systems to quantum hacking, especially passive attacks that are inherently difficult to detect. In this study, we experimentally and theoretically investigate the upper limit of the backflash attack-a representative passive side-channel threat. Using a fully equipped fiber-based QKD receiver, we demonstrate the feasibility of the attack and reveal its limited capability in distinguishing quantum states. We further develop a theoretical framework to quantify the maximum distinguishability achievable by an eavesdropper, taking into account the broadband spectral nature of backflash photons. The analysis shows that Eve can extract effective key information from at most 95.7% of the backflash photons. Based on these findings, we evaluate the secure key rate of a decoy-state BB84 QKD system under backflash attack. Our results provide a quantitative assessment of the vulnerability of QKD systems to backflash emissions and offer a general methodology to evaluate the practical security of QKD systems.

Abstract:
We introduce Quantum Feature Extraction (QuFeX), a novel quantum machine learning module. The proposed module enables feature extraction in a reduced-dimensional space, significantly decreasing the number of parallel evaluations required in typical quantum convolutional neural network architectures. Its design allows seamless integration into deep classical neural networks, making it particularly suitable for hybrid quantum-classical models. As an application of QuFeX, we propose Qu-Net -- a hybrid architecture which integrates QuFeX at the bottleneck of a U-Net architecture. The latter is widely used for image segmentation tasks such as medical imaging and autonomous driving. Our numerical analysis indicates that the Qu-Net can achieve superior segmentation performance compared to a U-Net baseline. These results highlight the potential of QuFeX to enhance deep neural networks by leveraging hybrid computational paradigms, providing a path towards a robust framework for real-world applications requiring precise feature extraction.

Abstract:
Non-Hermitian systems are widespread in both classical and quantum physics. The dynamics of such systems has recently become a focal point of research, showcasing surprising behaviors that include apparent violation of the adiabatic theorem and chiral topological conversion related to encircling exceptional points (EPs). These have both fundamental interest and potential practical applications. Yet the current literature features a number of apparently irreconcilable results. Here we develop a general theory for slow evolution of non-Hermitian systems and resolve these contradictions. We prove an analog of the adiabatic theorem for non-Hermitian systems and generalize it in the presence of uncontrolled environmental fluctuations (noise). The effect of noise turns out to be crucial due to inherent exponential instabilities present in non-Hermitian systems. Disproving common wisdom, the end state of the system is determined by the final Hamiltonian only, and is insensitive to other details of the evolution trajectory in parameter space. Our quantitative theory, leading to transparent physical intuition, is amenable to experimental tests. It provides efficient tools to predict the outcome of the system's evolution, avoiding the need to follow costly time-evolution simulations. Our approach may be useful for designing devices based on non-Hermitian physics and may stimulate analyses of classical and quantum non-Hermitian-Hamiltonian dynamics, as well as that of quantum Lindbladian and hybrid-Liouvillian systems.

Abstract:
Magic state distillation (MSD) is the leading approach to generate the non-Clifford resources required for universal fault-tolerant quantum computation. While most analyses assume ideal measurements in the distillation process, this assumption breaks down on near-term hardware where measurement fidelity remains limited and large quantum error-correcting codes are unavailable. Here we establish a general framework to analyze MSD under imperfect measurements, and reveal a sharp threshold phenomenon that differs from previous known threshold on input state error: Below a critical measurement strength, MSD loses its distillation power entirely, whereas above the threshold, the \textit{target states} are at most first-order biased and the \textit{distillation efficiency} is reduced to linear, leading to exponentially higher distillation overheads. To mitigate this fragility, we present a universal method to maximize MSD robustness against imperfect measurements by choosing stabilizer generators in standard form, which applies to all known protocols without incurring additional costs. Our work reveal fundamental constraints on MSD protocols with measurement noise and provide insights for designing practically robust distillation protocols in the near-term era of quantum hardware.

Abstract:
A key challenge in achieving scalable fault tolerance in superconducting quantum processors is readout fidelity, which lags behind one- and two-qubit gate fidelity. A major limitation in improving qubit readout is measurement-induced transitions, also referred to as qubit ionization, caused by multiphoton qubit-resonator excitation occurring at specific photon numbers. Since ionization can involve highly excited states, it has been predicted that in transmons -- the most widely used superconducting qubit -- the photon number at which measurement-induced transitions occur is gate charge dependent. This dependence is expected to persist deep in the transmon regime where the qubit frequency is gate charge insensitive. We experimentally confirm this prediction by characterizing measurement-induced transitions with increasing resonator photon population while actively stabilizing the transmon's gate charge. Furthermore, because highly excited states are involved, achieving quantitative agreement between theory and experiment requires accounting for higher-order harmonics in the transmon Hamiltonian.

Abstract:
We present a quantum variational algorithm based on a novel circuit that generates all permutations that can be spanned by one- and two-qubits permutation gates. The construction of the circuits follows from group-theoretical results, most importantly the Bruhat decomposition of the group generated by the \(\mathtt{cx}\) gates. These circuits require a number of qubits that scale logarithmically with the permutation dimension, and are therefore employable in near-term applications. We further augment the circuits with ancilla qubits to enlarge their span, and with these we build ansatze to tackle permutation-based optimization problems such as quadratic assignment problems, and graph isomorphisms. The resulting quantum algorithm, \textsc{QuPer}, is competitive with respect to classical heuristics and we could simulate its behavior up to a problem with $256$ variables, requiring $20$ qubits.

Abstract:
Recovering both amplitude and phase information from a system is a fundamental goal of optical imaging. At the same time, it is crucial to operate at low photon doses to avoid altering the sample, particularly in biological applications. Quantum imaging provides a powerful route to extract more information per photon than classical techniques, which are ultimately limited by shot-noise. However, the trade-off between quantum noise reduction and spatial resolution has long been regarded as a major obstacle to the application of quantum techniques to small cellular and sub-cellular structures, where they could offer the greatest benefits. Here, we overcome this limitation by demonstrating sub-shot-noise quantitative phase imaging of biological cells based on the transport-of-intensity equation, enabling high-fidelity, label-free imaging of key cellular and sub-cellular features. We achieve high-resolution phase imaging limited only by the numerical aperture, while simultaneously obtaining a resolution-independent quantum advantage. Unlike other quantum imaging approaches, our method operates in a quasi-single-shot, wide-field configuration, retrieves both phase and amplitude information, and does not rely on interferometric measurements, making it intrinsically fast and stable. These results pave the way for the immediate application of sub-shot-noise imaging in biological microscopy.

Abstract:
We present an exact analytical solution of the Hu-Paz-Zhang master equation in a precise Markovian limit for a system of two harmonically coupled harmonic oscillators interacting with a common thermal bath of harmonic oscillators. The thermal bath is initially considered to be at arbitrary temperatures and characterized by an Ohmic Lorentz-Drude spectral density. In the examined system, couplings between the two harmonic oscillators and the environment ensure a complete decoupling of the center-of-mass and relative degrees of freedom, resulting in undamped dynamics in the relative coordinate. The exact time evolution is used to analyze the system's entanglement dynamics, quantified through logarithmic negativity and quantum mutual information, while ensuring the positivity of the density operator to confirm the physical validity of the results. We demonstrate that, under certain parameter regimes and initial conditions, the asymptotic dynamics can give rise to periodic entanglement-disentanglement behavior. Furthermore, numerical simulations reveal that for negative values of the direct coupling between the oscillators, which are sufficiently close to a critical lower bound beyond which the system becomes unstable, the system can maintain entanglement across a broad temperature range and for arbitrarily long durations.

Abstract:
A multi-product formula (MPF) is a promising approach for Hamiltonian simulation efficiently both in the system size $N$ and the inverse allowable error $1/\varepsilon$ by combining Trotterization and the linear combination of unitaries (LCU). It achieves poly-logarithmic cost in $1/\varepsilon$ like LCU [G. H. Low, V. Kliuchnikov, N. Wiebe, arXiv:1907.11679 (2019)]. The efficiency in $N$ is expected to come from the commutator scaling in Trotterization, and this appears to be confirmed by the error bound of MPF expressed by nested commutators [J. Aftab, D. An, K. Trivisa, arXiv:2403.08922 (2024)]. However, we point out that the efficiency of MPF in the system size $N$ is not exactly resolved yet in that the present error bound expressed by nested commutators is incompatible with the size-efficient complexity reflecting the commutator scaling. The problem is that $q$-fold nested commutators with arbitrarily large $q$ are involved in their requirement and error bound. The benefit of commutator scaling by locality is absent, and the cost efficient in $N$ becomes prohibited in general. In this paper, we show an alternative commutator-scaling error of MPF and derive its size-efficient cost properly inheriting the advantage in Trotterization. The requirement and the error bound in our analysis, derived by techniques from the Floquet-Magnus expansion, have a certain truncation order in the nested commutators and can fully exploit the locality. We prove that Hamiltonian simulation by MPF certainly achieves the cost whose system-size dependence is as large as Trotterization while keeping the $\mathrm{polylog}(1/\varepsilon)$-scaling like the LCU. Our results will provide improved or accurate error and cost also for various algorithms using interpolation or extrapolation of Trotterization.

Abstract:
Superconducting microwave resonators are used in many low-power applications, such as the study of two-level system loss in superconducting quantum devices. Fano asymmetry, characterized by a nonzero asymmetry angle $φ$ in the diameter correction method, results from the coupling schemes used to measure these devices, including the commonly used hanger method. $φ$ is an additional fitting parameter which contains no physically interesting information and can obscure device parameters of interest. The T-junction symmetry nominally present in these resonator devices provides an avenue for the elimination of Fano asymmetry using calibrated measurement. We show that the eigenvalue associated with the common mode excitation of the resonator is an effective reflection mode (ERM) which has no Fano asymmetry. Our analysis reveals the cause of Fano asymmetry as interference between common and differential modes. Practically, we obtain the ERM from a linear combination of calibrated reflection and transmission measurements. We utilize a three-dimensional aluminum cavity to experimentally demonstrate the validity and flexibility of this model. To extend the usefulness of this symmetry analysis, we apply perturbation theory to recover the ERM in a multiplexed coplanar waveguide resonator device and experimentally demonstrate quantitative agreement in the extracted $Q_i^{-1}$ between hanger mode and ERM measurements. We observe a fivefold reduction in uncertainty from the ERM compared to the standard hanger mode at the lowest measured power, $-160$ dBm delivered to the device. This method could facilitate an increase in throughput of low-power superconducting resonator measurements by up to a factor of 25, as well as allow the extraction of critical parameters from otherwise unfittable device data.

Abstract:
In the era of big data and artificial intelligence, the increasing volume of data and the demand to solve more and more complex computational challenges are two driving forces for improving the efficiency of data storage, processing and analysis. Quantum image processing (QIP) is an interdisciplinary field between quantum information science and image processing, which has the potential to alleviate some of these challenges by leveraging the power of quantum computing. In this work, we compare and examine the compression properties of four different Quantum Image Representations (QImRs): namely, Tensor Network Representation (TNR), Flexible Representation of Quantum Image (FRQI), Novel Enhanced Quantum Representation NEQR, and Quantum Probability Image Encoding (QPIE). Our simulations show that FRQI and QPIE perform a higher compression of image information than TNR and NEQR. Furthermore, we investigate the trade-off between accuracy and memory in binary classification problems, evaluating the performance of quantum kernels based on QImRs compared to the classical linear kernel. Our results indicate that quantum kernels provide comparable classification average accuracy but require exponentially fewer resources for image storage.

Abstract:
Quantum entanglement is key to understanding correlations and emergent phenomena in quantum many-body systems. For $N$ qubits (distinguishable spin-$1/2$ particles) in a pure quantum state, many-body entanglement can be characterized by the purity of the reduced density matrix of a subsystem, defined as the trace of the square of this reduced density matrix. Nevertheless, this approach depends on the choice of subsystem. In this letter, we establish an exact relation between the Wehrl-Rényi entropy (WRE) $S_W^{(2)}$, which is the 2nd Rényi entropy of the Husimi function of the entire system, and the purities of all possible subsystems. Specifically, we prove the relation $e^{-S_W^{(2)}} = (6π)^{-N} \sum_A \mathrm{Tr}({{\hat ρ}_A}^2)$, where $A$ denotes a subsystem with reduced density matrix ${\hat ρ}_A$, and the summation runs over all $2^N$ possible subsystems. Furthermore, we show that the WRE can be experimentally measured via a concrete scheme. Therefore, the WRE is a subsystem-independent and experimentally measurable characterization of the overall entanglement in pure states of $N$ qubits. It can be applied to the study of strongly correlated spin systems, particularly those with all-to-all couplings that do not have a natural subsystem division, such as systems realized with natural atoms in optical tweezer arrays or superconducting quantum circuits. We also analytically derive the WRE for several representative many-body states, including Haar-random states, the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, and the W state.

Abstract:
Engineering coherent spatial superpositions of levitated large masses is an ongoing challenge. Borrowing from recent experimental work, we consider a charged mass of hundreds of nanometers size (``nanoparticle'') co-trapped with an ion in a Paul trap, and propose a scheme to manipulate its spatial state through the Coulomb interaction with the ion. We focus on the achievable delocalisation, only sketching the other challenges of the protocol (initial cooling, preservation of coherence for long-enough times, and detection). We prove that our scheme can displace coherently the nanoparticle by a few nanometers, with state-of-the-art parameters. Though smaller than the nanoparticle's size, this is much larger than the wavefunction of the trap's ground state. Thus the co-trapping scheme is in principle able to demonstrate macroscopic delocalisation of a charged nanoparticle.

Abstract:
We present a general framework to model spontaneous emission in integrated photonic structures by exploiting quantization of the electromagnetic field in terms of asymptotic in/out modes. This approach allows for an efficient and physically meaningful calculation of the emission rate into each radiative channel of an arbitrary structure, without relying on approximations such as Lorentzian lineshapes or point-like system-bath coupling. We show that with this approach one can recover well-known results for dipole emission in waveguides or ring resonators, and that such results can be easily extended to include the effect of backscattering. Finally, as an application, we design a tunable integrated single-photon source that enables full control over both the emission rate and output mode. This flexibility makes our method particularly well-suited for the design and analysis of integrated single-photon sources in various material platforms.

Abstract:
While the preparation of a general quantum state is challenging, realistic problem instances, such as those encountered in quantum chemistry and quantum machine learning-typically exhibit hierarchical amplitude structures, consisting of a small number of large components alongside a vast number of small but non-negligible ones. Standard approaches deterministically truncate the small amplitude would incur an approximation error that scales linearly with the discarded amplitude mass, enforcing a rigid trade-off between precision and circuit depth. Here, we circumvent the challenge by introducing a randomized state-preparation protocol with probabilistic amplification of small amplitudes using ensembles of low-complexity circuits. Analytically, we prove that this approach significantly reduces the number of encoded amplitudes, halving the requirement for exponentially decaying states and offering asymptotically larger gains for heavy-tailed power-law decays. Numerical simulations on LiH molecular wavefunctions and deep-learning-derived states demonstrate reductions of up to 99 percent in CNOT and T-gate counts compared with deterministic methods. These results establish a resource-efficient paradigm for initializing complex states, relaxing gate-synthesis precision requirements for both near-term and fault-tolerant hardware, and improving the end-to-end feasibility of quantum computing.

Abstract:
We report on a mathematical model of the photoelectric response of NV colour centres in diamond, that can be employed for sensing and quantum science information applications. Although the model applies to NV centre in diamond, it can be applied with small modifications to other semiconducting solid state qubits. In our model, we include the drift and collection of charge carriers as well as the presence of other defects via generation and recombination dynamics. Though the photoluminescence readout and the associated dynamics of the NV defect has been extensively studied experimentally and theoretically, so far, there has been no precise model for photocurrent readout, including these effects. In our description, we use a multilevel-level system including mS=0, mS=+-1 ground and excited states, singlet state and the NV0 neutral state. Also, the presence of substitutional nitrogen (NS), which for example determines the spin coherence via the paramagnetic spin bath, is discussed together with presence of acceptor defects. We model the time-dependent occupation of all electronic sublevels and also consider the electronic charge transport from the Boltzmann transport equation, leading to information about the charge state transitions and recombination dynamics. ODMR and PDMR response as well as their quantum efficiencies, are calculated. On this basis, we determine an optimal parameter space for qubit operations, including the highest spin contrast and especially relate those to NS presence. The model is confirmed experimentally and can become a useful tool for optimisation of the performance of NV qubit photoelectric readout.

Abstract:
Continuous-variables (CV) quantum optics is a natural formalism for neural networks (NNs) due to its ability to reproduce the information processing of such trainable interconnected systems. In quantum optics, Gaussian operators induce affine mappings on the quadratures of optical modes while non-Gaussian resources (the challenging piece for physical implementation) originate the nonlinear effects, unlocking quantum analogs of an artificial neuron. This work presents a novel experimentally-feasible framework for continuous-variable quantum optical neural networks (QONNs) developed with available photonic components: coherent states as input encoding, a general Gaussian transformation followed by multi-mode photon subtractions as the processing layer, and homodyne detection as outputs readout. The closed-form expressions of such architecture are derived demonstrating the family of adaptive activations and the quantum-optical neurons that emerge from the amount of photon-subtracted modes, proving that the proposed design satisfies the Universal Approximation Theorem within a single layer. To classically simulate the QONN training, the high-performance QuaNNTO library has been developed based on Wick-Isserlis expansion and Bogoliubov transformations, allowing multi-layer exact expectation values of non-Gaussian states without truncating the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. Experiments on supervised learning and state-preparation tasks show balanced-resource efficiency with strong expressivity and generalization capabilities, illustrating the potential of the architecture for scalable photonic quantum machine learning and for quantum applications such as complex non-Gaussian gate synthesis.

Abstract:
We study distributed similarity estimation of quantum channels (DSEC), a primitive for cross-platform verification where two remote quantum devices are compared by estimating the inner product of their Choi states. We show that the optimal channel query complexity of DSEC for two $d$-dimensional quantum channels is $Θ(\max\{\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon, 1/\varepsilon^2\})$, where $\varepsilon$ is the additive error. We first prove an information-theoretic lower bound with this scaling, which holds even in the strongest setting, allowing adaptive strategies, multiple rounds of classical communication, and coherent access with arbitrary ancillas. We then give a matching upper bound in the weakest setting, namely non-adaptive and ancilla-free incoherent access, via a randomized measurement protocol achieving this bound. Finally, we show that our protocol achieves a quadratic improvement over classical shadow baselines. Our results provide theoretically optimal and practical methods for cross-platform verification, quantum device benchmarking, and distributed quantum learning.

Abstract:
We develop a framework for learning from noisy quantum experiments in which fault-tolerant devices access uncharacterized systems through noisy couplings. Introducing the complexity class $\textsf{NBQP}$ ("noisy BQP''), we model noisy fault-tolerant quantum computers that cannot generally error-correct the oracle systems they query. Using this class, we prove that while noise can eliminate the exponential quantum learning advantages of unphysical, noiseless learners, a superpolynomial gap remains between $\textsf{NISQ}$ and fault-tolerant devices. Turning to canonical learning tasks in noisy settings, we find that the exponential two-copy advantage for purity testing collapses under local depolarizing noise. Nevertheless, we identify a setting motivated by AdS/CFT in which noise-resilient physical structure restores this quantum learning advantage. We then analyze noisy Pauli shadow tomography, deriving lower bounds characterizing how instance size, quantum memory and noise jointly control sample complexity, and design algorithms with parametrically matching scalings. We study similar tradeoffs in quantum metrology, and show that the Heisenberg-limited sensitivity of existing error-correction-based protocols persists only up to a timescale inverse-polynomial in the error rate per probe qubit. Together, our results demonstrate that the primitives underlying quantum-enhanced experiments are fundamentally fragile to noise, and that realizing meaningful quantum advantages in future experiments will require interfacing noise-robust physical properties with available algorithmic techniques.

Abstract:
We give a compact, frame-independent characterization of the set of classical second-order moments for a single spin-1 particle. Defining the moment matrix M = 2Q + (1/3) I, we show that a moment pair (s, Q) arises from a positive mixture of spin-coherent states if and only if M is positive semidefinite, M minus ss^T is positive semidefinite, and the trace of M equals one. These necessary and sufficient matrix conditions delimit the classical moment region and yield simple, basis-free witnesses of higher-order tensor nonclassicality, such as bounds on Tr(Q^2). A constructive proof of sufficiency is given in the appendix.

Abstract:
We investigate the fluctuation-induced Casimir interactions between two parallel graphene sheets carrying steady-state drift currents. The graphene properties are modeled based on the shifted Fermi disk model to capture the non-equilibrium optical response of the system. We find that the drift current introduces a repulsive correction to the perpendicular to the layers Casimir interaction, thereby reducing the overall attractive force. Although the correction is repulsive, it does not overcome the underlying attraction between the layers. It also generates a lateral force that opposes the carrier flow direction. Both contributions are studied in terms of distance and drift velocity functionalities showing pathways for Casimir force control.

Abstract:
Duality, not monism, constitutes the hermeneutic lens that characterizes the original Copenhagen interpretation of Quantum Mechanics. Therefore, evoking the principles of correspondence and complementarity, in this work we re-assert a dual-aspect reading of quantum theory, structured through a multi-perspective schema encompassing its ontological, analytical, epistemological, causal, and information dimensions. We then show how this schema dissolves the so-called 'measurement problem', along with the associated 'knowledge-information' and 'macro-micro' dichotomies, issues historically raised within later monistic or universalist philosophical settings that ultimately depart from the traditional Copenhagen spirit.

Abstract:
The $k$-QSAT problem is a quantum analog of the famous $k$-SAT constraint satisfaction problem. We must determine the zero energy ground states of a Hamiltonian of $N$ qubits consisting of a sum of $M$ random $k$-local rank-one projectors. It is known that product states of zero energy exist with high probability if and only if the underlying factor graph has a clause-covering dimer configuration. This means that the threshold of the PRODSAT phase is a purely geometric quantity equal to the dimer covering threshold. We revisit and fully prove this result through a combination of complex analysis and algebraic methods based on Buchberger's algorithm for complex polynomial equations with random coefficients. We also discuss numerical experiments investigating the presence of entanglement in the PRODSAT phase in the sense that product states do not span the whole zero energy ground state space.

Abstract:
Leveraging the rapid development of quantum simulators, the intriguing phenomena of quantum string are observed across various quantum simulation platforms. However, the complex interplay between the quantum strings cannot be well analyzed due to the limited system size in real quantum simulators. Here, with the help of a newly developed quantum Monte Carlo method, we can simulate a larger-scale Kagome Rydberg atom array, providing an ideal playground for studying quantum strings. By introducing a novel edge pinning method, the ends of a quantum string can be attached to edges so that the flexible manipulation of the quantum string becomes possible. Due to the geometric constraint, the quantum strings are unidirectional, which strongly complicates their interplay. To quantitatively describe the quantum string, we built a one-dimensional effective model. With both analytic and numerical methods, rich physics can be found, including ``geometric breaking", heart-like superposition state of quantum strings, and the attractive inter-string interactions. This work can benefit the comprehension of quantum strings and may also shed light on the simulation of high-energy physics.

Abstract:
The Casimir force follows from quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field and yields a nonlinear attractive force between closely spaced conductive objects. Its magnitude depends on the conductivity of the objects up to optical frequencies. Measuring the Casimir force in superconductors should allow to isolate frequency-specific contributions to the Casimir effect, as frequencies below the superconducting gap energy are expected to contribute differently than those above it. There is significant interest in this contribution as it is suspected to contribute to an unexplained discrepancy between predictions and measurements of the Casimir force between normal metals, which questions the basic principles on which estimates of the magnitude are based. Here, we observe the Casimir force between superconducting objects through the nonlinear dynamics it imparts to a superconducting drum resonator in a microwave optomechanical system. There is excellent agreement between the experiment and the Casimir force magnitude computed for this device across three orders of magnitude of displacement. Furthermore, the Casimir nonlinearity is intense enough that, with a modified design, this device type should operate in the single-phonon nonlinear regime. Accessing this regime has been a long-standing goal that would greatly facilitate quantum operations of mechanical resonators.

Abstract:
We construct a topological space $\mathcal{B}$ consisting of translation invariant injective matrix product states (MPS) of all physical and bond dimensions and show that it has the weak homotopy type $K(\mathbb{Z}, 2) \times K(\mathbb{Z}, 3)$. The implication is that the phase of a family of such states parametrized by a space $X$ is completely determined by two invariants: a class in $H^2(X; \mathbb{Z})$ corresponding to the Chern number per unit cell and a class in $H^3(X; \mathbb{Z})$, the so-called Kapustin-Spodyneiko (KS) number. The space $\mathcal{B}$ is defined as the quotient of a contractible space $\mathcal{E}$ of MPS tensors by an equivalence relation describing gauge transformations of the tensors. We prove that the projection map $p:\mathcal{E} \rightarrow \mathcal{B}$ is a quasifibration, and this allows us to determine the weak homotopy type of $\mathcal{B}$. As an example, we review the Chern number pump-a family of MPS parametrized by $S^3$-and prove that it generates $π_3(\mathcal{B})$.

Abstract:
Describing and understanding the physical properties of quantum many-body non-Hermitian systems is a challenging task. In this work, we generalize the eta-pairing theory to non-Hermitian Hubbard models on arbitrary lattices and find many novel phenomena without Hermitian analogs. For instance, the Hermitian conjugate of an eta-pairing eigenoperator may not be an eigenoperator, eta-pairing eigenoperators can be spatially modulated, and the $SU(2)$ pseudospin symmetry may not be possible even if $H$ commutes with the eta-pairing operators. Remarkably, these novel non-Hermitian phenomena are closely related to each other by several theorems we establish and can lead to, for example, new types of eta-pairing operators (e.g., the notion of non-Hermitian angular-momentum operators) and the anomalous localization (e.g., the skin effect) of eta-pairing eigenstates. Some issues on the $SO(4)$ and particle-hole symmetries are clarified. Our general eta-pairing theory also reveals a previously unnoticed unification of these symmetries of the Hubbard model. To exemplify these findings, we first propose the Hatano-Nelson-Hubbard model. In this interacting non-Hermitian system without even the bulk translation invariance, the right and left two-particle eta-pairing eigenstates are exponentially localized at opposite boundaries of the chain. Then, we generalize this model to two dimensions and find that the eta-pairing eigenstates can exhibit the first- or second-order skin effect. Finally, a general two-sublattice model is constructed to realize all of the non-Hermitian eta-pairing phenomena. This work provides a new and rigorous theoretical framework for studying novel physical phenomena (e.g., the skin effect) in interacting non-Hermitian many-body systems, even in arbitrary spatial dimensions and without the bulk translation symmetry.

Abstract:
Magnetic orders of non-Heisenberg Tsai-type 1/1 approximant crystals (ACs) in the Au-Ga-Dy system were studied through bulk magnetization, neutron diffraction, and inelastic neutron scattering techniques. The results uncovered noncoplanar, ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin configurations whirling along [111] crystallographic axis, which is analogous to those observed in the Tb- and Ho-contained counterparts. The crystal electric field excitations similar to those in the Tb-based counterpart are also observed indicating the strong Ising-like magnetic anisotropy. These comprehensive experiments and analyses have revealed the existence of a universal mechanism that stabilizes noncoplanar FM and AFM structures in non-Heisenberg Tsai-type ACs, independent of the rare-earth species (Tb, Dy, Ho); FM intra-cluster interactions and strong Ising-like anisotropy.

Abstract:
Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQRs) have emerged as a promising solution for evolving wireless receivers from the classical to the quantum domain. To further unleash their great potential in wireless communications, we propose a flexible architecture for Rydberg atomic quantum multiple-input multiple-output (RAQ-MIMO) receivers in the multi-user uplink. Then the corresponding signal model of the RAQ-MIMO system is constructed by paving the way from quantum physics to classical wireless communications. Explicitly, we outline the associated operating principles and transmission flow. We also validate the linearity of our model and its feasible region. Based on our model, we derive closed-form asymptotic formulas for the ergodic achievable rate (EAR) of both the maximum-ratio combining (MRC) and zero-forcing (ZF) receivers operating in uncorrelated fading channels (UFC) and the correlated fading channels (CFC), as well as in the standard quantum limit (SQL) and photon shot limit (PSL) regimes, respectively. Furthermore, we unveil that the EAR scales logarithmically without bound with the product of effective number $N_{\text{atom}}$ and coherence time $T_2$ of the atomic ensemble in the SQL regime, but exhibits non-monotonic trade-off between the collective atomic enhancement and optical-depth-dependent attenuation in the PSL regime. More particularly, the transmit power of users can be scaled down quadratically with $N_{\text{atom}} τ$, $τ\in \{ T_2, \frac{ {\cal C} (Ω_{\ell}) }{A_p} \}$, but the EAR per user retains fixed, by increasing $N_{\text{atom}}$ while retaining the sensor number $M \propto N_{\text{atom}} τ$ in the SQL regime or $M \propto \exp \big( \frac{N_{\text{atom}} {\bar χ}}{A_p} \big)$ in the PSL regime....

Abstract:
Diamond and diamond color centers have become prime hardware candidates for solid state-based technologies in quantum information and computing, optics, photonics and (bio)sensing. The synthesis of diamond materials with specific characteristics and the precise control of the hosted color centers is thus essential to meet the demands of advanced applications. Yet, challenges remain in improving the concentration, uniform distribution and quality of these centers. Here, we perform a review and meta-analysis of some of the main diamond synthesis methods and their parameters for the synthesis of N-, Si-, Ge- and Sn-vacancy color-centers. We extract quantitative data from over 60 experimental papers and organize it in a large database (170 data sets and 1692 entries). We then use the database to train two machine learning algorithms to make robust predictions about the fabrication of diamond materials with specific properties from careful combinations of synthesis parameters. We use traditional statistical indicators to benchmark the performance of the algorithms and show that they are powerful and resource-efficient tools for researchers and material scientists working with diamond color centers and their applications.

Abstract:
To encode quantum information in semiconductor spin qubits, voltage pulses are necessary for initialization, gate operation, and readout. However, these pulses dissipate heat, shifting spin-qubit frequencies and reducing gate fidelities. The cause of this pulse heating in quantum-dot devices is unknown. Here, we measure pulse heating using charged two-level fluctuators (TLFs) in Si/SiGe quantum dots. Specifically, we observe that voltage pulses on nearby gates tend to increase TLF switching rates and occupation biases. The amount of heating depends on the pulse amplitude and frequency, but not on the distance between the pulsed gates and the TLFs. The amount of heating also generally depends on the idling voltage of the pulsed gates, suggesting that electrons accumulated under or near the gates contribute to the heating. We hypothesize that reducing the area of the gates with electrons nearby could mitigate the heating.

Abstract:
Cold atoms are promising platforms for metrology and quantum computation, yet their many-body dynamics remains largely unexplored. We here investigate Rabi oscillations from optically-thick cold clouds, driven by high-intensity coherent light. A dynamical displacement from the atomic resonance is predicted, which can be detected through the collective Rabi oscillations of the atomic ensemble. Different from linear-optics shifts, this dynamical displacement grows quadratically with the optical depth, yet it reduces with increasing pump power as dipole-dipole interactions are less effective.

Abstract:
We introduce a general corner transfer matrix renormalization group algorithm tailored to projected entangled-pair states on the triangular lattice. By integrating automatic differentiation, our approach enables direct variational energy minimization on this lattice geometry. In contrast to conventional approaches that map the triangular lattice onto a square lattice with diagonal next-nearest-neighbour interactions, our native formulation yields improved variational results at the same bond dimension. This improvement stems from a more faithful and physically informed representation of the entanglement structure in the tensor network and an increased number of variational parameters. We apply our method to the antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbour Heisenberg model on the triangular and kagome lattice, and benchmark our results against previous numerical studies.

Abstract:
We study the hard-core Fermi-Hubbard model in the crossover between square and triangular lattices near half-filling. As was recognized by Nagaoka in the 1960s, on the square lattice the presence of a single hole leads to ferromagnetic spin ordering. On the triangular lattice, geometric frustration instead leads to a spin-singlet ground state, which can be associated with a 120-degree spiral order. On lattices which interpolate between square and triangular, there is a phase transition at which the ferromagnetic order becomes unstable to a spin spiral. We model this transition, finding the exact location of the spin-spiral instability.

Abstract:
Bilinear observation problems arise in many physical and information-theoretic settings, where observables and states enter multiplicatively. Rank-based diagnostics are commonly used in such problems to assess the effective dimensionality accessible to observation, often under the implicit assumption that rank deficiency can be resolved through numerical refinement. Here we examine this assumption by analyzing the rank and nullity of a bilinear observation operator under systematic tolerance variation. Rather than focusing on a specific reconstruction algorithm, we study the operator directly and identify extended rank plateaus that persist across broad tolerance ranges. These plateaus indicate stable dimensional deficits that are not removed by refinement procedures applied within a fixed problem definition. To investigate the origin of this behavior, we resolve the nullspace into algebraic sectors defined by the block structure of the variables. The nullspace exhibits a pronounced but nonexclusive concentration in specific sectors, revealing an organized internal structure rather than uniform dimensional loss. Comparing refinement with explicit modification of the problem formulation further shows that rank recovery in the reported setting requires a change in the structure of the observation problem itself. Here, "problem modification" refers to changes that alter the bilinear observation structure (e.g., admissible operator/state families or coupling constraints), in contrast to refinements that preserve the original formulation such as tolerance adjustment and numerical reparameterizations. Together, these results delineate limits of rank recovery in bilinear observation problems and clarify the distinction between numerical refinement and problem modification in accessing effective dimensional structure.

Abstract:
Wave packet revivals and fractional revivals are hallmark quantum interference phenomena that arise in systems with nonlinear energy spectra, and their signatures in expectation values of observables have been studied extensively in earlier work. In this article, we build on these studies and extend the analysis in two important directions. First, we investigate fractional revival dynamics in angular momentum observables, deriving explicit expressions for the time evolution of their moments and demonstrating that higher-order angular momentum moments provide clear and selective signatures of fractional revivals. Second, we examine classical analogs of quantum revival phenomena and elucidate structural similarities between quantum fractional revivals and recurrence behavior in representative classical systems. Using the Kerr-type nonlinear Hamiltonian as a paradigmatic model, we analyze the autocorrelation function, moment dynamics, and phase-space structures, supported by visualizations such as quantum carpets. Our results broaden the range of experimentally accessible diagnostics of fractional revivals and provide a unified perspective on revival phenomena across quantum and classical dynamical systems.

Abstract:
Spontaneous symmetry breaking is one of the central organizing principles in physics. Time crystals have emerged as an exotic phase of matter, spontaneously breaking the time translational symmetry, and are mainly categorized as discrete or continuous. While these distinct types of time crystals have been extensively explored as standalone systems, intriguing effects can arise from their mutual interaction. Here, we demonstrate that a time-independent coupled system of discrete and continuous time crystals induces a simultaneous two-fold temporal symmetry breaking, resulting in a hierarchical time crystal phase. Interestingly, one of the subsystems breaks an emergent discrete temporal symmetry that does not exist in the dynamical generator but rather emerges dynamically, leading to a convoluted non-equilibrium phase. We demonstrate that hierarchical time crystals are robust, emerging for fundamentally different coupling schemes and persisting across wide ranges of system parameters.

Abstract:
The aim of this work is to study the zero-error capacity of pure-state classical-quantum channels in the setting of list decoding. We provide an achievability bound for list-size two and a converse bound holding for every fixed list size. The two bounds coincide for channels whose pairwise absolute state overlaps form a positive semi-definite matrix. Finally, we discuss a remarkable peculiarity of the classical-quantum case: differently from the fully classical setting, the rate at which the sphere-packing bound diverges might not be achievable by zero-error list codes, even when we take the limit of fixed but arbitrarily large list size.

Abstract:
A key challenge in quantum sensing is the detection of weak time dependent signals, particularly those that arise as specific frequency perturbations over a background field. Conventional methods usually demand complex dynamical control of the quantum sensor and heavy classical post-processing. We propose a quantum sensor that leverages time independent interactions and entanglement to function as a passive, tunable, thresholded frequency filter. By encoding the frequency selectivity and thresholding behavior directly into the dynamics, the sensor is responsive only to a target frequency of choice whose amplitude is above a threshold. This approach circumvents the need for complex control schemes and reduces the post-processing overhead.

Abstract:
Product code construction is a powerful tool for constructing quantum stabilizer codes, which serve as a promising paradigm for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computation. Furthermore, the natural mapping between stabilizer codes and the ground states of exactly solvable spin models also motivates the exploration of many-body orders in the stabilizer codes. In this work, we investigate the fracton topological orders in a family of codes obtained by a recently proposed general construction. More specifically, this code family can be regarded as a class of generalized hypergraph product (HGP) codes. We term the corresponding exactly solvable spin models \textit{orthoplex models}, based on the geometry of the stabilizers. In the 3D orthoplex model, we identify a series of intriguing properties within this model family, including non-monotonic ground state degeneracy (GSD) as a function of system size and non-Abelian lattice defects. Most remarkably, in 4D we discover \textit{fragmented topological excitations}: while such excitations manifest as discrete, isolated points in real space, their projections onto lower-dimensional subsystems form connected objects such as loops, revealing the intrinsic topological nature of these excitations. Therefore, fragmented excitations constitute an intriguing intermediate class between point-like and spatially extended topological excitations. In addition, these rich features establish the generalized HGP codes as a versatile and analytically tractable platform for studying the physics of fracton orders.

Abstract:
We theoretically investigate the optical dipole interaction between a multi-level quantum system and a single-mode optical waveguide of any local polarisation. We investigate several paradoxical seeming situations, for example we find a situation in which there exist two non-orthogonal quantum states, each of which results in a photon flux in the opposite direction to the other. We show how, despite appearances, this does not break the unitary requirements of quantum mechanics. We also find that an isotropic quantum emitter can be either reflective or transmissive to light depending on the waveguide polarisation at the emitter location, indeed in the zero loss limit such a system changes from 100% transmission to 100% reflection due to an infinitesimal polarisation rotation. An example case for a four level system is also considered, which is found to operate as a non-destructive parity measurement of the photon number.

Abstract:
Quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes have emerged as a promising approach for realizing low-overhead logical quantum memories. Recent theoretical developments have established shift automorphisms as a fundamental building block for completing the universal set of logical gates for qLDPC codes. However, practical challenges remain because the existing SWAP-based shift automorphism yields logical error rates that are orders of magnitude higher than those for fault-tolerant idle operations. In this work, we address this issue by dynamically varying the syndrome measurement circuits to implement the shift automorphisms without reducing the circuit distance. We benchmark our approach on both twisted and untwisted weight-6 generalized toric codes, including the gross code family. Our time-dynamic circuits for shift automorphisms achieve performance comparable to the idle operations under the circuit-level noise model (SI1000). Specifically, the dynamic circuits achieve more than an order of magnitude reduction in logical error rates relative to the SWAP-based scheme for the gross code at a physical error rate of $10^{-3}$, employing the BP-OSD decoder. Our findings improve both the error resilience and the time overhead of the shift automorphisms in qLDPC codes. Furthermore, our work can lead to alternative syndrome extraction circuit designs, such as leakage removal protocols, providing a practical pathway to utilizing dynamic circuits that extend beyond surface codes towards qLDPC codes.

Neural network decoders like AlphaQubit have demonstrated potential, achieving higher accuracy than traditional human-designed decoding algorithms. However, existing implementations of neural network decoders lack the parallelism required to decode the syndrome stream generated by a superconducting logical qubit in real time. Moreover, integrating AlphaQubit with sliding window-based parallel decoding schemes presents non-trivial challenges: AlphaQubit is trained solely to output a single bit corresponding to the global logical correction for an entire memory experiment, rather than local physical corrections that can be easily integrated. We address this issue by training a recurrent, transformer-based neural network specifically tailored for parallel window decoding. While it still outputs a single bit, we derive training labels from a consistent set of local corrections and train on various types of decoding windows simultaneously. This approach enables the network to self-coordinate across neighboring windows, facilitating high-accuracy parallel decoding of arbitrarily long memory experiments.   As a result, we overcome the throughput bottleneck that previously precluded the use of AlphaQubit-type decoders in FTQC. Our work presents the first scalable, neural-network-based parallel decoding framework that simultaneously achieves SOTA accuracy and the stringent throughput required for real-time quantum error correction. Using an end-to-end experimental workflow, we benchmark our decoder on the Zuchongzhi 3.2 superconducting quantum processor on surface codes with distances up to 7, demonstrating its superior accuracy. Moreover, we demonstrate that, using our approach, a single TPU v6e is capable of decoding surface codes with distances up to 25 within 1us per decoding round.

Abstract:
Quantum annealing is typically regarded as a tool for combinatorial optimization, but its coherent dynamics also offer potential for machine learning. We present a model that encodes classical data into an Ising Hamiltonian, evolves it on a quantum annealer, and uses the resulting probability distributions as feature maps for classification. Experiments on the quantum annealer machine with the Digits dataset, together with simulations on MNIST, demonstrate that short annealing times yield higher classification accuracy, while longer times reduce accuracy but lower sampling costs. We introduce the participation ratio as a measure of the effective model size and show its strong correlation with generalization.

Abstract:
Quantum Computing (QC) has evolved from a few custom quantum computers, which were only accessible to their creators, to an array of commercial quantum computers that can be accessed on the cloud by anyone. Accessing these cloud quantum computers requires a complex chain of tools that facilitate connecting, programming, simulating algorithms, estimating resources, submitting quantum computing jobs, retrieving results, and more. Some steps in the chain are hardware dependent and subject to change as both hardware and software tools, such as available gate sets and optimizing compilers, evolve. Understanding the trade-offs inherent in this process is essential for evaluating the power and utility of quantum computers. ARLIS has been systematically investigating these environments to understand these complexities. The work presented here is a detailed summary of three months of using such quantum programming environments. We show metadata obtained from these environments, including the connection metrics to the different services, the execution of algorithms, the testing of the effects of varying the number of qubits, comparisons to simulations, execution times, and cost. Our objective is to provide concrete data and insights for those who are exploring the potential of quantum computing. It is not our objective to present any new algorithms or optimize performance on any particular machine or cloud platform; rather, this work is focused on providing a consistent view of a single algorithm executed using out-of-the-box settings and tools across machines, cloud platforms, and time. We present insights only available from these carefully curated data.

Abstract:
The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for computing ground state energies of molecular systems. We implement VQE to calculate the potential energy surface of the hydrogen molecule (H$_2$) across 100 bond lengths using the PennyLane quantum computing framework on an HPC cluster featuring 4$\times$ NVIDIA H100 GPUs (80GB each). We present a comprehensive parallelization study with four phases: (1) Optimizer + JIT compilation achieving 4.13$\times$ speedup, (2) GPU device acceleration achieving 3.60$\times$ speedup at 4 qubits scaling to 80.5$\times$ at 26 qubits, (3) MPI parallelization achieving 28.5$\times$ speedup, and (4) Multi-GPU scaling achieving 3.98$\times$ speedup with 99.4% parallel efficiency across 4 H100 GPUs. The combined effect yields 117$\times$ total speedup for the H$_2$ potential energy surface (593.95s $\rightarrow$ 5.04s). We conduct a CPU vs GPU scaling study from 4--26 qubits, finding GPU advantage at all scales with speedups ranging from 10.5$\times$ to 80.5$\times$. Multi-GPU benchmarks demonstrate near-perfect scaling with 99.4% efficiency and establish that a single H100 can simulate up to 29 qubits before hitting memory limits. The optimized implementation reduces runtime from nearly 10 minutes to 5 seconds, enabling interactive quantum chemistry exploration.

Abstract:
Photon statistics plays a governing role in multi-photon interference. While interference visibility in the standard two-photon case, known as Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, monotonically degrades with higher intensity correlation functions, we show that this monotonicity does not hold for three-photon interference in symmetric circuits. We reveal that, in the discrete Fourier transform circuit, engineered super-Poissonian photon-number fluctuations, realized using a modulated laser, maximize the visibility, surpassing the magnitude of the single-photon signature. In addition, by tuning the symmetric circuit parameters, we demonstrate that the visibility hierarchy inverts relative to the benchmark of Poissonian statistics. This trade-off implies that quantum and classical advantages are mutually exclusive resources for interference, indicating a form of statistical complementarity.

Abstract:
The subadditivity-doubling-rotation (SDR) technique is a powerful route to Gaussian optimality in classical information theory and relies on strict subadditivity and its equality-case analysis, where double Markovity is a standard tool. We establish quantum analogues of double Markovity. For tripartite states, we characterize the simultaneous Markov conditions A-B-C and A-C-B via compatible projective measurements on B and C that induce a common classical label J yielding A-J-(BC). For strictly positive four-party states, we show that A-(BD)-C and A-(CD)-B hold if and only if A-D-(BC) holds. These results remove a key bottleneck in extending SDR-type arguments to quantum systems.

Abstract:
Recent studies of moiré physics have unveiled a wealth of opportunities for significantly advancing the field of quantum phase transitions. However, properties of reentrant phase transitions driven by moiré strength are poorly understood. Here, we investigate the reentrant sequence of phase transitions and the invariant of universality class in moiré-modulated extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. For the simplified case with intercell hopping $w=0$, we analytically derive renormalization relations of Hamiltonian parameters to explain the reentrant phenomenon. For the general case, numerical phase boundaries are calculated in the thermodynamic limit. The bulk boundary correspondence between zero-energy edge modes and entanglement spectrum is revealed from the degeneracy of both quantities. We also address the correspondence between the central charge obtained from entanglement entropy and the change in winding number during the phase transition. Our results shed light on the understanding of universal characteristics and bulk-boundary correspondence for moiré induced reentrant phase transitions in 1D condensed-matter systems.

Abstract:
Decision making often exhibits context dependence that challenges classical probability theory. While quantum cognition has successfully modeled such phenomena, it remains unclear whether quantum probability is merely a convenient assumption or a necessary consequence of decision dynamics. Here we present a theoretical framework in which contextuality arises generatively from physically grounded constraints on decision making. By developing a quantum extension of the Tug-of-War (TOW) model, we show that conservation-based internal state updates and measurement-induced disturbance preclude any non-contextual classical description with a single, unified internal state. Contextuality therefore emerges as a structural consequence of adaptive learning dynamics. We further show that the resulting measurement structure admits Klyachko-Can-Binicioglu-Shumovsky (KCBS)-type contextuality witnesses in a minimal single-system setting. These results indicate that quantum probability is not merely a descriptive convenience, but an unavoidable effective theory for adaptive decision dynamics.

Abstract:
The high overhead of fault-tolerant measurement sequences (FTMSs) poses a major challenge for implementing quantum stabilizer codes. Here, we address this problem by constructing efficient FTMSs for the class of quantum Hamming codes $[\![2^r-1, 2^r-1-2r, 3]\!]$ with $r=3k+1$ ($k \in \mathbb{Z}^+$). Our key result demonstrates that the sequence length can be reduced to exactly $2r+1$-only one additional measurement beyond the original non-fault-tolerant sequence, establishing a tight lower bound. The proposed method leverages cyclic matrix transformations to systematically combine rows of the initial stabilizer matrix and preserving a self-dual CSS-like symmetry analogous to that of the original quantum Hamming codes. This induced symmetry enables hardware-efficient circuit reuse: the measurement circuits for the first $r$ stabilizers are transformed into circuits for the remaining $r$ stabilizers simply by toggling boundary Hadamard gates, eliminating redundant hardware. For distance-3 fault-tolerant error correction, our approach simultaneously reduces the time overhead via shorting the FTMS length and the hardware overhead through symmetry-enabled circuit multiplexing. These results provide an important advance towards the important open problem regarding the design of minimal FTMSs for quantum Hamming codes and may shed light on similar challenges in other quantum stabilizer codes.

Abstract:
Quantum state tomography is essential for characterizing quantum systems, but it becomes infeasible for large systems due to exponential resource scaling. Overlapping tomography addresses this challenge by reconstructing all $k$-body marginals using few measurement settings, enabling the efficient extraction of key information for many quantum tasks. While optimal schemes are known for qubits, the extension to higher-dimensional qudit systems remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate optimal qudit overlapping tomography, constructing local measurement settings from generalized Gell-Mann matrices. By establishing a correspondence with combinatorial covering arrays, we present two explicit constructions of optimal measurement schemes. For $n$-qutrit systems, we prove that pairwise tomography requires at most $8 + 56\left\lceil \log_{8} n \right\rceil$ measurement settings, and provide an explicit scheme achieving this bound. Furthermore, we develop an efficient algorithm to determine the optimal order of these measurement settings, minimizing the experimental overhead associated with switching configurations. Compared to the worst-case ordering, our optimized schedule reduces switching costs by approximately 50\%. These results provide a practical pathway for efficient characterization of qudit systems, facilitating their application in quantum communication and computation.

Abstract:
Static phase detuning fundamentally constrains coherent state transfer in asymmetric classical and quantum systems. We introduce a Bloch-sphere formulation for piecewise-coherent modulation that recasts coupled-mode dynamics as geometric trajectories, transforming algebraic control into path optimization. The approach reveals a cone of inaccessibility at the target pole and yields exact geodesic criteria for complete mode conversion in detuned systems. Leveraging this framework, we break time-reversal symmetry to realize a magnet-free optical isolator with near-unity contrast. Furthermore, for detuning larger than coupling between modes, we develop a recursive multi-step protocol enabling deterministic transfer for arbitrary detunings and derive a universal geometric lower bound on the required number of coupling-switching events.

Abstract:
We study the Fano effect in dissipative cavity quantum electrodynamics, which originates from the interference between the emitter's direct radiation and that mediated by a cavity mode. Starting from a two-level system coupled to a structured reservoir, we show that a quantum master equation previously derived within the Born-Markov approximation can be rederived by introducing a single auxiliary mode via pseudomode approach. We identify the corresponding spectral function of the system--environment interaction and demonstrate that it consists of a constant and a non-Lorentzian contribution forming the Fano profile. The constant term is shown to be essential for obtaining a Lindblad master equation and is directly related to the rate associated with this Fano interference. Furthermore, by applying Fano diagonalization to a common-environment setup including an explicit cavity mode, we independently derive the same spectral function in the strongest-interference regime. Our results establish a unified framework for describing the Fano effect in single-mode cavity QED systems and clarify its non-Markovian origin encoded in the spectral function.

Abstract:
Magic states are essential for universal quantum computation and are widely viewed as a key source of quantum advantage, yet in realistic devices they are inevitably noisy. In this work, we characterize how noise on injected magic resources changes the classical simulability of quantum circuits and when it induces a transition from classically intractable behavior to efficient classical simulation. We adopt a resource-centric noise model in which only the injected magic components are noisy, while the baseline states, operations, and measurements belong to an efficiently simulable family. Within this setting, we develop an approximate classical sampling algorithm with controlled error and prove explicit noise-dependent conditions under which the algorithm runs in polynomial time. Our framework applies to both qubit circuits with Clifford baselines and fermionic circuits with matchgate baselines, covering representative noise channels such as dephasing and particle loss. We complement the analysis with numerical estimates of the simulation cost, providing concrete thresholds and runtime scaling across practically relevant parameter regimes.

Abstract:
Casimir forces arise from quantum electromagnetic fluctuations and depend on the dielectric response of interacting materials across the entire frequency spectrum. Although this dependence is central to Lifshitz theory of the Casimir effect, the formulation of the force in terms of dielectric functions evaluated at imaginary frequencies has largely obscured its connection to real-frequency optical properties, limiting the use of Casimir interactions as a probe of materials. Here we demonstrate that Casimir force measurements encode sufficient information to reconstruct a material's broadband optical response. Using supervised machine learning to invert Lifshitz theory, we determine the complex permittivity of a material over more than seven orders of magnitude in frequency from a single force-distance curve. We show that measurements at different separations selectively constrain distinct frequency ranges of the dielectric response, providing direct physical insight into how quantum fluctuations sample the electromagnetic spectrum. These results establish Casimir interactions as a physically constrained, broadband spectroscopic tool and open new opportunities for optical characterization in regimes inaccessible to conventional techniques.

Abstract:
The transition to the fault-tolerant era exposes the limitations of homogeneous quantum systems, where no single qubit modality simultaneously offers optimal operation speed, connectivity, and scalability. In this work, we propose a strategic approach to Heterogeneous Quantum Architectures (HQA) that synthesizes the distinct advantages of the superconducting (SC) and neutral atom (NA) platforms. We explore two architectural role assignment strategies based on hardware characteristics: (1) We offload the latency-critical Magic State Factory (MSF) to fast SC devices while performing computation on scalable NA arrays, a design we term MagicAcc, which effectively mitigates the resource-preparation bottleneck. (2) We explore a Memory-Compute Separation (MCSep) paradigm that utilizes NA arrays for high-density qLDPC memory storage and SC devices for fast surface-code processing. Our evaluation, based on a comprehensive end-to-end cost model, demonstrates that principled heterogeneity yields significant performance gains. Specifically, our designs achieve $752\times$ speedup over NA-only baselines on average and reduce the physical qubit footprint by over $10\times$ compared to SC-only systems. These results chart a clear pathway for leveraging cross-modality interconnects to optimize the space-time efficiency of future fault-tolerant quantum computers.

Abstract:
Recent studies have extensively explored chaotic dynamics in quantum optical systems through the mean-field approximation, which corresponds to an ideal, fluctuation-free scenario. However, the inherent sensitivity of chaos to initial conditions implies that even minute fluctuations can be amplified, thereby questioning the applicability of this approximation. Here, we analyze these chaotic effects using stochastic Langevin equations or the Lindblad master equation. For systems operating at frequencies of $10^5$ to $10^7$ Hz, we demonstrate that room-temperature thermal fluctuations are sufficient to suppress chaos at the level of expectation values, even under weak nonlinearity. Furthermore, nonlinearity induces deviations from Gaussian phase-space distributions of the quantum state, revealing attractor-like features in the Wigner function. With increasing nonlinearity, the noise threshold for chaos suppression decreases, approaching the scale of vacuum fluctuations. These results provide a bidirectional validation of the quantum mechanical suppression of chaos.

Abstract:
Quantum algorithms are gaining attention in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for their favorable scaling, as encoding physical fields into quantum probability amplitudes enables representation of two to the power of n spatial points with only n qubits. A key challenge in Quantum CFD is the efficient readout of simulation results, a topic that has received limited attention in literature. This work presents methods to extract statistical properties of spatial velocity fields, such as central moments and structure functions, directly from parameterized ansatz circuits, avoiding full quantum state tomography. As a proof of concept, we implement our approach for 1D velocity fields, encoding 16 spatial points with 4 qubits, and analyze both a sine wave signal and four snapshots from Burgers' equation evolution. Using Qedma's error mitigation software QESEM, we demonstrate that such computations achieve high accuracy on current quantum devices, specifically IBMQ's Heron2 system ibm_fez.

Abstract:
Historically, the focus in entanglement distillation has predominantly been on the distillable entanglement, and the framework assumes complete knowledge of the initial state. In this paper, we study the reliability function of entanglement distillation, which specifies the optimal exponent of the decay of the distillation error when the distillation rate is below the distillable entanglement. Furthermore, to capture greater operational significance, we extend the framework from the standard setting of known states to a black-box setting, where distillation is performed from a set of possible states. We establish an exact finite blocklength result connecting to composite correlated hypothesis testing without any redundant correction terms. Based on this, the reliability function of entanglement distillation is characterized by the regularized quantum Hoeffding divergence. In the special case of a pure initial state, our result reduces to the error exponent for entanglement concentration derived by Hayashi et al. in 2003. Given full prior knowledge of the state, we construct a concrete optimal distillation protocol. Additionally, we analyze the strong converse exponent of entanglement distillation. While all the above results assume the free operations to be non-entangling, we also investigate other free operation classes, including PPT-preserving, dually non-entangling, and dually PPT-preserving operations.

Abstract:
We demonstrate that large language model (LLM) agents can autonomously perform tensor network simulations of quantum many-body systems, achieving approximately 90% success rate across representative benchmark tasks. Tensor network methods are powerful tools for quantum simulation, but their effective use requires expertise typically acquired through years of graduate training. By combining in-context learning with curated documentation and multi-agent decomposition, we create autonomous AI agents that can be trained in specialized computational domains within minutes. We benchmark three configurations (baseline, single-agent with in-context learning, and multi-agent with in-context learning) on problems spanning quantum phase transitions, open quantum system dynamics, and photochemical reactions. Systematic evaluation using DeepSeek-V3.2, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Claude Opus 4.5 demonstrates that both in-context learning and multi-agent architecture are essential. Analysis of failure modes reveals characteristic patterns across models, with the multi-agent configuration substantially reducing implementation errors and hallucinations compared to simpler architectures.

Abstract:
Studying the complexity of states sampled from various ensembles is a central component of quantum information theory. In this work we establish the average-case hardness of learning, in the statistical query model, the Born distributions of states sampled uniformly from the circular and (fermionic) Gaussian ensembles. These ensembles of states are induced variously by the uniform measures on the compact symmetric spaces of type AI, AII, and DIII. This finding complements analogous recent results for states sampled from the classical compact groups. On the technical side, we employ a somewhat unconventional approach to integrating over the compact groups which may be of some independent interest. For example, our approach allows us to exactly evaluate the total variation distances between the output distributions of Haar random unitary and orthogonal circuits and the constant distribution, which were previously known only approximately.

Abstract:
Pre-execution calibration is a major bottleneck for operating superconducting quantum processors, and qubit frequency allocation is especially challenging due to crosstalk-coupled objectives. We establish that the widely-used Snake optimizer is mathematically equivalent to Block Coordinate Descent (BCD), providing a rigorous theoretical foundation for this calibration strategy. Building on this formalization, we present a topology-aware block ordering obtained by casting order selection as a Sequence-Dependent Traveling Salesman Problem (SD-TSP) and solving it efficiently with a nearest-neighbor heuristic. The SD-TSP cost reflects how a given block choice expands the reduced-circuit footprint required to evaluate the block-local objective, enabling orders that minimize per-epoch evaluation time. Under local crosstalk/bounded-degree assumptions, the method achieves linear complexity in qubit count per epoch, while retaining calibration quality. We formalize the calibration objective, clarify when reduced experiments are equivalent or approximate to the full objective, and analyze convergence of the resulting inexact BCD with noisy measurements. Simulations on multi-qubit models show that the proposed BCD-NNA ordering attains the same optimization accuracy at markedly lower runtime than graph-based heuristics (BFS, DFS) and random orders, and is robust to measurement noise and tolerant to moderate non-local crosstalk. These results provide a scalable, implementation-ready workflow for frequency calibration on NISQ-era processors.

Abstract:
We analyze quantum state preservation in open quantum systems using quantum error-correcting (QEC) codes that are explicitly embedded into microscopic system-bath models. Instead of abstract quantum channels, we consider multi-qubit registers coupled to bosonic thermal environments, derive a second-order master equation for the reduced dynamics, and use it to benchmark the five-qubit, Steane, and toric codes under local and collective noise. We compute state fidelities for logical qubits as functions of coupling strength, bath temperature, and the number of correction cycles. In the low-temperature regime, we find that repeated error-correction with the five-qubit code strongly suppresses decoherence and relaxation, while in the high-temperature regime, thermal excitations dominate the dynamics and reduce the benefit of all codes, though the five-qubit code still outperforms the Steane and toric codes. For two-qubit Werner states, we identify a critical evolution time before which QEC does not improve fidelity, and this time increases as entanglement grows. After this critical time, QEC does improve fidelity. Comparative analysis further reveals that the five-qubit code (the smallest perfect code) offers consistently higher fidelities than topological and concatenated architectures in these open-system settings. These findings establish a quantitative framework for evaluating QEC under realistic noise environments and provide guidance for developing noise-resilient quantum architectures in near-term quantum technologies.

Abstract:
We investigate the coherence properties of parity-protected $\cos(2\varphi)$ qubits based on interferences between two Josephson elements in a superconducting loop. We show that qubit implementations of a $\cos(2\varphi)$ potential using a single loop, such as those employing semiconducting junctions, rhombus circuits, flowermon and KITE structures, can be described by the same Hamiltonian as two multi-harmonic Josephson junctions in a SQUID geometry. We find that, despite the parity protection arising from the suppression of single Cooper pair tunneling, there exists a fundamental trade-off between charge and flux noise dephasing channels. Using numerical simulations, we examine how relaxation and dephasing rates depend on external flux and circuit parameters, and we identify the best compromise for maximum coherence. With currently existing circuit parameters, the qubit lifetime $T_1$ can exceed milliseconds while the dephasing time $T_\varphi$ remains limited to only a few microseconds due to either flux or charge noise. Our findings establish practical limits on the coherence of this class of qubits and raise questions about the long-term potential of this approach.

Abstract:
In the thermodynamic limit, the Dicke-Ising chain maps exactly onto an effective self-consistent matter Hamiltonian with the photon field acting solely as a self-consistent effective field. As a consequence, no quantum correlations between photons and spins are needed to understand the quantum phase diagram. This enables us to determine the quantum phase diagram in the thermodynamic limit using numerical linked-cluster expansions combined with density matrix renormalization group calculations (NLCE+DMRG) to solve the resulting self-consistent matter Hamiltonian. This includes magnetically ordered phases with significantly improved accuracy compared to previous estimates. For ferromagnetic Ising couplings, we refine the location of the multicritical point governing the change in the order of the superradiant phase transition, reaching a relative accuracy of $10^{-4}$. For antiferromagnetic Ising couplings, we confirm the existence of the narrow antiferromagnetic superradiant phase in the thermodynamic limit. The effective matter Hamiltonian framework identifies the antiferromagnetic superradiant phase as the many-body ground state of an antiferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model with longitudinal field. This phase emerges through continuous Dicke-type polariton condensation from the antiferromagnetic normal phase, followed by a first-order transition to the paramagnetic superradiant phase. Thus, NLCE+DMRG provides a precise determination of the Dicke-Ising phase diagram in one dimension by solving the self-consistent effective matter Hamiltonian.

Abstract:
This paper presents a systematic study of adversarial hypothesis testing for both quantum-quantum (QQ) and classical-quantum (CQ) channels. Unlike conventional channel discrimination, we consider a framework where the sender, Alice, selects the channel input adversarially to minimize Bob's distinguishability. We analyze this problem across four settings based on whether Alice employs i.i.d. or general inputs and whether the receiver, Bob, is informed of the specific input choice (allowing his measurement to depend on the input). We characterize the Stein exponents for each setting and reveal a striking distinction in behavior: for QQ channels with i.i.d. inputs, Bob's knowledge of the input significantly enhances distinguishability, yet this advantage vanishes when general inputs are permitted. In contrast, for CQ channels, Bob being informed provides a consistent advantage over the corresponding entanglement-breaking channels for both i.i.d. and general inputs. These results demonstrate a unique phenomenon in adversarial hypothesis testing where the CQ channel does not merely behave as a special case of the QQ channel.

Abstract:
We investigate the open system dynamics of a micromaser quantum battery operating in the ultrastrong coupling (USC) regime under environmental dissipation. The battery consists of a single-mode electromagnetic cavity sequentially interacting, via the Rabi Hamiltonian, with a stream of qubits acting as chargers. Dissipative effects arise from the weak coupling of the qubit-cavity system to a thermal bath. Non-negligible in the USC regime, the counter-rotating terms substantially improve the charging speed, but also lead, in the absence of dissipation, to unbounded energy growth and highly mixed cavity states. Dissipation during each qubit-cavity interaction mitigates these detrimental effects, yielding steady-state of finite energy and ergotropy. Optimal control on qubit preparation and interaction times enhances battery's performance in: (i) Maximizing the stored ergotropy trhough an optimized charging protocol; (ii) Stabilizing the stored ergotropy against dissipative losses through an optimized measurement-based passive-feedback strategy. Overall, our numerical results demonstrate that the interplay of ultrastrong light-matter coupling, controlled dissipation, and optimized control strategies enables micromaser quantum batteries to achieve both enhanced charging performance and long-term stability under realistic conditions.

Abstract:
Several photonic quantum technologies rely on the ability to generate multiple indistinguishable photons. Benchmarking the level of indistinguishability of these photons is essential for scalability. The Hong-Ou-Mandel dip provides a benchmark for the indistinguishability between two photons, and extending this test to the multi-photon setting has so far resulted in a protocol that computes the genuine n-photon indistinguishability (GI). However, this protocol has a sample complexity that increases exponentially with the number of input photons for an estimation of GI up to a given additive error. To address this problem, we introduce new theorems that strengthen our understanding of the relationship between distinguishability and the suppression laws of the quantum Fourier transform interferometer (QFT). Building on this, we propose a protocol using the QFT for benchmarking GI that achieves constant sample complexity for the estimation of GI up to a given additive error for prime photon numbers, and sub-polynomial scaling otherwise, representing an exponential improvement over the state of the art. We prove the optimality of our protocol in many relevant scenarios and validate our approach experimentally on Quandela's reconfigurable photonic quantum processor, where we observe a clear advantage in runtime and precision over the state of the art. We therefore establish the first scalable method for computing multi-photon indistinguishability, which applies naturally to current and near-term photonic quantum hardware.

Abstract:
This paper presents a theoretical study of the light-induced shift of the coherent population trapping resonance. An analytical model is proposed that describes the interaction of two radiation components with an atomic system using a $Λ$ scheme and takes into account an additional level of excited state. Both weak and strong coupling regimes with off-resonant transitions are considered. It is shown that, in addition to the conventional dynamic Stark shift, an extra shift arises due to the distortion of the resonance line shape when bichromatic laser radiation interacts with off-resonant atomic transitions. An analytical expression for this additional shift is derived in the weak-coupling limit, and its significant impact on the resonance shape and sensitivity to the intensities of the laser field components is demonstrated. It is found that under strong coupling conditions, the additional shift can deviate substantially from a linear dependence on light intensity, suggesting new opportunities for controlling light shifts in precision atomic devices such as quantum frequency standards.

Abstract:
The manipulation of distinct degrees of freedom of photons plays a critical role in both classical and quantum information processing. While the principles of wave optics provide elegant and scalable control over classical light in spatial and temporal domains, engineering quantum states in Fock space has been largely restricted to few-photon regimes, hindered by the computational and experimental challenges of large Hilbert spaces. Here, we introduce ``Fock-space optics", establishing a conceptual framework of wave propagation in the quantum domain by treating photon number as a synthetic dimension. Using a superconducting microwave resonator, we experimentally demonstrate Fock-space analogues of optical propagation, refraction, lensing, dispersion, and interference with up to 180 photons. These results establish a fundamental correspondence between Schrödinger evolution in a single bosonic mode and classical paraxial wave propagation. By mapping intuitive optical concepts onto high-dimensional quantum state engineering, our work opens a path toward scalable control of large-scale quantum systems with thousands of photons and advanced bosonic information processing.

Abstract:
We investigate the experimental prospects for testing a relativistic local quantum measurement inequality that quantifies the trade-off between vacuum insensitivity and responsiveness to excitations for finite-size detectors. Building on the Reeh--Schlieder approximation for coherent states, we derive an explicit and practically applicable bound for arbitrary coherent states. To connect with realistic photodetection scenarios, we model the detection region as a square prism operating over a finite time window and consider a normally incident single-mode coherent state. Numerical results exhibit the expected qualitative behavior: suppressing dark counts necessarily tightens the achievable click probability.

Abstract:
Learning the Hamiltonian governing a quantum system is a central task in quantum metrology, sensing, and device characterization. Existing Heisenberg-limited Hamiltonian learning protocols either require multi-qubit operations that are prone to noise, or single-qubit operations whose frequency or strength increases with the desired precision. These two requirements limit the applicability of Hamiltonian learning on near-term quantum platforms. We present a protocol that learns a quantum Hamiltonian with the optimal Heisenberg-limited scaling using only single-qubit control in the form of static fields with strengths that are independent of the target precision. Our protocol is robust against the state preparation and measurement (SPAM) error. By overcoming these limitations, our protocol provides new tools for device characterization and quantum sensing. We demonstrate that our method achieves the Heisenberg-limited scaling through rigorous mathematical proof and numerical experiments. We also prove an information-theoretic lower bound showing that a non-vanishing static field strength is necessary for achieving the Heisenberg limit unless one employs an extensive number of discrete control operations.

Abstract:
High-Q bosonic memories are central to hardware-efficient quantum error correction, but their isolation makes fast, high-fidelity reset a persistent bottleneck. Existing approaches either rely on weak intermode cross-Kerr conversion or on measurement-based sequences with substantial latency. Here we demonstrate a hardware-efficient Rabi-Driven Reset (RDR) that implements continuous, measurement-free cooling of a superconducting cavity mode. A strong resonant Rabi drive on a transmon, together with sideband drives on the memory and readout modes detuned by the Rabi frequency, converts the dispersive interaction into an effective Jaynes-Cummings coupling between the qubit dressed states and each mode. This realizes a tunable dissipation channel from the memory to the cold readout bath. Crucially, the engineered coupling scales with the qubit-mode dispersive interaction and the drive amplitude, rather than with the intermode cross-Kerr, enabling fast cooling even in very weakly coupled architectures that deliberately suppress direct mode-mode coupling. We demonstrate RDR of a single photon with a decay time of $1.2 μs$, more than two orders of magnitude faster than the intrinsic lifetime. Furthermore, we reset about 30 thermal photons in about $80 μs$ to a steady-state average photon number of $\bar{n} = 0.045 \pm 0.025$.

We further provide a strategy on how to adapt these bounds to smoothed divergences.

Abstract:
Calculating bounds of properties of many-body quantum systems is of paramount importance, since they guide our understanding of emergent quantum phenomena and complement the insights obtained from estimation methods. Recent semidefinite programming approaches enable probabilistic bounds from finite-shot measurements of easily accessible, yet informationally incomplete, observables. Here we render these methods scalable in the number of qubits by instead utilizing moment-matrix relaxations. After introducing the general formalism, we show how the approach can be adapted with specific knowledge of the system, such as it being the ground state of a given Hamiltonian, possessing specific symmetries or being the steady state of a given Lindbladian. Our approach defines a scalable real-world certification scheme leveraging semidefinite programming relaxations and experimental estimations which, unavoidably, contain shot noise.

Abstract:
The evolution of an isolated quantum system inevitably exhibits recurrence: the state returns to the vicinity of its initial condition after finite time. Despite its fundamental nature, a rigorous quantitative understanding of recurrence has been lacking. We establish upper bounds on the recurrence time, $t_{\mathrm{rec}} \lesssim t_{\mathrm{exit}}(ε)(1/ε)^d$, where $d$ is the Hilbert-space dimension, $ε$ the neighborhood size, and $t_{\mathrm{exit}}(ε)$ the escape time from this neighborhood. For pure states evolving under a Hamiltonian $H$, estimating $t_{\mathrm{exit}}$ is equivalent to an inverse quantum speed limit problem: finding upper bounds on the time a time-evolved state $ψ_t$ needs to depart from the $ε$-vicinity of the initial state $ψ_0$. We provide a partial solution, showing that under mild assumptions $t_{\mathrm{exit}}(ε) \approx ε/\sqrt{ Δ(H^2)}$, with $Δ(H^2)$ the Hamiltonian variance in $ψ_0$. We show that our upper bound on $t_{\mathrm{rec}}$ is generically saturated for random Hamiltonians. Finally, we analyze the impact of coherence of the initial state in the eigenbasis of $H$ on recurrence behavior.

Abstract:
Classical and quantum physics represent two distinct theories; however, quantum physics is regarded as the more fundamental of the two. It is posited that classical mechanics should arise from quantum mechanics under certain limiting conditions. Nevertheless, this remains a challenging objective. In this work, we explore the potential for unifying the dynamics of classical and quantum physics. This discussion does not suggest that classical behavior emerges from quantum mechanics; rather, it demonstrates the exact equivalence between the dynamics of quantum observables and their classical counterparts. It is shown that the Heisenberg equations of motion can be cast in a form that is identical to Newton's equations of motion, with $\hbar$ being absent from the formulation. This implies that both quantum and classical dynamics are governed by the same equations, with the Heisenberg operators substituting the classical observables.

Abstract:
The thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) imposes a fundamental constraint between current fluctuations and entropy production, providing a refined formulation of the second law for micro- and nanoscale systems. Quantum violations of the classical TUR reveal genuinely quantum thermodynamic effects, which are essential for improving performance and enabling optimization in quantum technologies. In this work, we analyze the TUR in a class of paradigmatic quantum thermal-machine models whose operation is enabled by coherent coupling between two energy levels forming a virtual qubit. Steady-state coherences are confined to this virtual-qubit subspace, while in the absence of coherent coupling the system satisfies detailed balance with the thermal reservoirs and supports no steady-state heat currents. We show that the steady-state currents and entropy production can be fully reproduced by an effective classical Markov process, whereas current fluctuations acquire an additional purely quantum correction originating from coherence. As a result, the thermodynamic uncertainty naturally decomposes into a classical (diagonal) contribution and a coherent contribution. The latter becomes negative under resonant conditions and reaches its minimum at the coupling strength that maximizes steady-state coherence. We further identify the optimization conditions and the criteria for surpassing the classical TUR bound in the vicinity of the reversible limit.

Abstract:
We introduce SpinPulse, an open-source python package for simulating spin qubit-based quantum computers at the pulse-level. SpinPulse models the specific physics of spin qubits, particularly through the inclusion of classical non-Markovian noise. This enables realistic simulations of native gates and quantum circuits, in order to support hardware development. In SpinPulse, a quantum circuit is first transpiled into the native gate set of our model and then converted to a pulse sequence. This pulse sequence is subsequently integrated numerically in the presence of a simulated noisy experimental environment. We showcase workflows including transpilation, pulse-level compilation, hardware benchmarking, quantum error mitigation, and large-scale simulations via integration with the tensor-network library quimb. We expect SpinPulse to be a valuable open-source tool for the quantum computing community, fostering efforts to devise high-fidelity quantum circuits and improved strategies for quantum error mitigation and correction.

Abstract:
We present a unified scheme for generating high-fidelity entangling gates in superconducting platforms by continuous dynamical decoupling (CDD) combined with variational minimal-energy optimal control. During the CDD stage, we suppress residual couplings, calibration drifting, and quasistatic noise, resulting in a stable effective Hamiltonian that preserves the designed ZZ interaction intended for producing tunable couplers. In this stable $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ manifold, we calculate smooth low-energy single-quibt control functions using a variational geodesic optimization process that directly minimizes gate infidelity. We illustrate the methodology by applying it to CZ, CX, and generic engangling gates, achieving virtually unit fidelity and robustness under restricted single-qubit action, with experimentally realistic control fields. These results establish CDD-enhanced variational geometric optimal control as a practical and noise-resilient scheme for designing superconducting entangling gates.

Abstract:
We propose a generalization of the Filoche--Mayboroda localization landscape that extends the theory well beyond the static, elliptic and Hermitian settings while preserving its geometric interpretability. Using the positive operator $H^\dagger H$, we obtain a landscape that predicts localization across non-Hermitian, Floquet, and topological systems without computing eigenstates. Singular-value collapse reveals spectral instabilities and skin effects, the Sambe formulation captures coherent destruction of tunneling, and topological zero modes emerge directly from the landscape. Applications to Hatano--Nelson chains, driven two-level systems, and driven Aubry--André--Harper models confirm quantitative accuracy, establishing a unified predictor for localization in equilibrium and driven quantum matter.

Abstract:
Fast and high fidelity shuttling of spin qubits has been demonstrated in semiconductor quantum dot devices. Several architectures based on shuttling have been proposed; it has been suggested that singlet-triplet (dual-spin) qubits could be optimal for the highest shuttling fidelities. Here we present a fault-tolerant framework for quantum error correction based on such dual-spin qubits, establishing them as a natural realisation of erasure qubits within semiconductor architectures. We introduce a hardware-efficient leakage-detection protocol that automatically projects leaked qubits back onto the computational subspace, without the need for measurement feedback or increased classical control overheads. When combined with the XZZX surface code and leakage-aware decoding, we demonstrate a twofold increase in the error correction threshold and achieve orders-of-magnitude reductions in logical error rates. This establishes the singlet-triplet encoding as a practical route toward high-fidelity shuttling and erasure-based, fault-tolerant quantum computation in semiconductor devices.

Abstract:
We analyze quantum systems under a broad class of protocols in which the temperature and a Hamiltonian control parameter are ramped simultaneously and, in general, in a nonlinear fashion toward a quantum critical point. Using an open-system version of a Kitaev quantum wire as an example, we show that, unlike finite-temperature protocols at fixed temperature, these protocols allow us to probe, in an out-of-equilibrium situation and at finite temperature, the universality class (characterized by the critical exponents $ν$ and $z$) of an equilibrium quantum phase transition at zero temperature. Key to this is the identification of ramps in which both coherent and incoherent parts of the open-system dynamics affect the excitation density in a non-negligible way. We also identify the specific ramps for which subleading corrections to the asymptotic scaling laws are suppressed, which serves as a guide to dynamically probing quantum critical exponents in experimentally realistic finite-temperature situations.

Abstract:
Quantum Amplitude Amplification (QAA), the generalization of Grover's algorithm, is capable of yielding optimal solutions to combinatorial optimization problems with high probabilities. In this work we extend the conventional 2-dimensional representation of Grover's (orthogonal collective states) to oracles which encode cost functions such as QUBO, and show that linear cost functions are a special case whereby an exact formula exists for determining optimal oracle parameter settings. Using simulations of problem sizes up to 40 qubits we demonstrate QAA's algorithmic performance across all possible solutions, with an emphasis on the closeness in Grover-like performance for solutions near the global optimum. We conclude with experimental demonstrations of generalized QAA on both IBMQ (superconducting) and IonQ (trapped ion) qubits, showing that the observed probabilities of each basis state match our equations as a function of varying the free parameters in the oracle and diffusion operators.

Abstract:
Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are critically threatened by the Barren Plateau (BP) phenomenon. In this work, we introduce the H-EFT Variational Ansatz (H-EFT-VA), an architecture inspired by Effective Field Theory (EFT). By enforcing a hierarchical "UV-cutoff" on initialization, we theoretically restrict the circuit's state exploration, preventing the formation of approximate unitary 2-designs. We provide a rigorous proof that this localization guarantees an inverse-polynomial lower bound on the gradient variance: $Var[\partial θ] \in Ω(1/poly(N))$. Crucially, unlike approaches that avoid BPs by limiting entanglement, we demonstrate that H-EFT-VA maintains volume-law entanglement and near-Haar purity, ensuring sufficient expressibility for complex quantum states. Extensive benchmarking across 16 experiments -- including Transverse Field Ising and Heisenberg XXZ models -- confirms a 109x improvement in energy convergence and a 10.7x increase in ground-state fidelity over standard Hardware-Efficient Ansatze (HEA), with a statistical significance of $p < 10^{-88}$.

Abstract:
Neutral atom quantum processors have emerged as a promising platform for scalable quantum information processing, offering high-fidelity operations and exceptional qubit scalability. A key challenge in realizing practical applications is efficiently extracting readout outcomes while maintaining high system throughput, i.e., the rate of quantum task executions. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework to quantify the trade-off between readout fidelity and atomic retention. Moreover, we introduce a metric of quantum circuit iteration rate (qCIR) and employ normalized quantum Fisher information to characterize system overall performance. Further, by carefully balancing fidelity and retention, we demonstrate a readout strategy for optimizing information acquisition efficiency. Considering the experimentally feasible parameters for 87Rb atoms, we demonstrate that qCIRs of 197.2Hz and 154.5Hz are achievable using single photon detectors and cameras, respectively. These results provide practical guidance for constructing scalable and high-throughput neutral atom quantum processors for applications in sensing, simulation, and near-term algorithm implementation.

Abstract:
We study the computation of the $α$-Rényi capacity of a classical-quantum (c-q) channel for $α\in(0,1)$. We propose an exponentiated-gradient (mirror descent) iteration that generalizes the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm. Our analysis establishes relative smoothness with respect to the entropy geometry, guaranteeing a global sublinear convergence of the objective values. Furthermore, under a natural tangent-space nondegeneracy condition (and a mild spectral lower bound in one regime), we prove local linear (geometric) convergence in Kullback-Leibler divergence on a truncated probability simplex, with an explicit contraction factor once the local curvature constants are bounded.

Abstract:
The scalable and deterministic preparation of large Fock-number states represents a long-standing frontier in quantum science, with direct implications for quantum metrology, communication, and simulation. Despite significant progress in small-scale implementations, extending such state generation to large excitation numbers while maintaining high fidelity remains a formidable challenge. Here, we present a scalable protocol for generating large Fock states with fidelities exceeding 0.9 up to photon numbers on the order of 100, achieved using only native control operations and, when desired, further enhanced by an optional post-selection step. Our method employs a hybrid Genetic-Adam optimization framework that combines the global search efficiency of genetic algorithms with the adaptive convergence of Adam to optimize multi-pulse control sequences comprising Jaynes-Cummings interactions and displacement operations, both of which are native to leading experimental platforms. The resulting control protocols achieve high fidelities with shallow circuit depths and strong robustness against parameter variations. These results establish an efficient and scalable pathway toward high-fidelity non-classical state generation for precision metrology and fault-tolerant quantum technologies.

Abstract:
Whether neural information processing is entirely classical or involves quantum-mechanical elements remains an open question. Here we propose a model-agnostic, information-theoretic test of nonclassicality that bypasses microscopic assumptions and instead probes the structure of neural representations themselves. Using autoencoders as a transparent model system, we introduce a Bell-type consistency test in latent space, and ask whether decoding statistics obtained under multiple readout contexts can be jointly explained by a single positive latent-variable distribution. By shifting the search for quantum-like signatures in neural systems from microscopic dynamics to experimentally testable constraints on information processing, this work opens a new route for probing the fundamental physics of neural computation.

Abstract:
Quantum embedding methods, such as dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT), provide a powerful framework for investigating strongly correlated materials. A central computational bottleneck in DMFT is in solving the Anderson impurity model (AIM), whose exact solution is classically intractable for large bath sizes. In this work, we develop and benchmark a quantum-classical hybrid solver tailored for DMFT applications, using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) to prepare the ground state of the AIM with shallow quantum circuits. The solver uses a unified ansatz framework to prepare the particle and hole excitations of the ground-state from parameter-shifted circuits, enabling the reconstruction of the impurity Green's function through a continued-fraction expansion. We evaluate the performance of this approach across a few bath sizes and interaction strengths under noisy, shot-limited conditions. We compare three optimization routines (COBYLA, Adam, and L-BFGS-B) in terms of convergence and fidelity, assess the benefits of estimating a quantum-computed moment (QCM) correction to the variational energies, and benchmark the approach by comparing the reconstructed density of states (DOS) against that obtained using a classical pipeline. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of Green's function reconstruction on near-term devices and establish practical benchmarks for quantum impurity solvers embedded within self-consistent DMFT loops.

Abstract:
The entanglement distance of evolutionary quantum states of a two-spin system with the XXZ model has been studied. The analysis has been conducted both analytically and using quantum computing. An analytical dependence of the entanglement distance on the values of the model coupling constants and the parameters of the initial states has been obtained. The speed of evolution of a two-spin system has been investigated. The analysis has been performed analytically and using quantum computing. An explicit dependence of the speed of evolution on the coupling constants and on the parameters of the initial state has been obtained. The results of quantum computations are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions.

Abstract:
It is known that the continuous-time variant of Grover's search algorithm is characterized by quantum search frameworks that are governed by stationary Hamiltonians, which result in search trajectories confined to the two-dimensional subspace of the complete Hilbert space formed by the source and target states. Specifically, the search approach is ineffective when the source and target states are orthogonal. In this paper, we employ normalization, orthogonality, and energy limitations to demonstrate that it is unfeasible to breach time-optimality between orthogonal states with constant Hamiltonians when the evolution is limited to the two-dimensional space spanned by the initial and final states. Deviations from time-optimality for unitary evolutions between orthogonal states can only occur with time-dependent Hamiltonian evolutions or, alternatively, with constant Hamiltonian evolutions in higher-dimensional subspaces of the entire Hilbert space. Ultimately, we employ our quantitative analysis to provide meaningful insights regarding the relationship between time-optimal evolutions and analog quantum search methods. We determine that the challenge of transitioning between orthogonal states with a constant Hamiltonian in a sub-optimal time is closely linked to the shortcomings of analog quantum search when the source and target states are orthogonal and not interconnected by the search Hamiltonian. In both scenarios, the fundamental cause of the failure lies in the existence of an inherent symmetry within the system.

Abstract:
The Landau--Zener (LZ) model describes a two-level quantum system that undergoes an avoided crossing. In the adiabatic limit, the transition probability vanishes. An auxiliary control field $H_\text{CD}$ can be reverse-engineered so that the full Hamiltonian $H_0 + H_\text{CD}$ reproduces adiabaticity for all parameter values. Our aim is to construct a single control field $H_1$ that drives an ensemble of LZ-type Hamiltonians with a distribution of energy gaps. $H_1$ works best statistically, minimizing the average transition probability. We restrict our attention to a special class of $H_1$ controls, motivated by $H_\text{CD}$. We found a systematic trade-off between instantaneous adiabaticity and the final transition probability. Certain limiting cases with a linear sweep can be treated analytically; one of them being the LZ system with Dirac $δ(t)$ function. Comprehensive and systematic numerical simulations support and extend the analytic results.

Abstract:
We examine the pertinent geometric characteristics of entanglement that arise from stationary Hamiltonian evolutions transitioning from separable to maximally entangled two-qubit quantum states. From a geometric perspective, each evolution is characterized by means of geodesic efficiency, speed efficiency, and curvature coefficient. Conversely, from the standpoint of entanglement, these evolutions are quantified using various metrics, such as concurrence, entanglement power, and entangling capability. Overall, our findings indicate that time-optimal evolution trajectories are marked by high geodesic efficiency, with no energy resource wastage, no curvature (i.e., zero bending), and an average path entanglement that is less than that observed in time-suboptimal evolutions. Additionally, when analyzing separable-to-maximally entangled evolutions between nonorthogonal states, time-optimal evolutions demonstrate a greater short-time degree of nonlocality compared to time-suboptimal evolutions between the same initial and final states. Interestingly, the reverse is generally true for separable-to-maximally entangled evolutions involving orthogonal states. Our investigation suggests that this phenomenon arises because suboptimal trajectories between orthogonal states are characterized by longer path lengths with smaller curvature, which are traversed with a higher energy resource wastage compared to suboptimal trajectories between nonorthogonal states. Consequently, a higher initial degree of nonlocality in the unitary time propagators appears to be essential for achieving the maximally entangled state from a separable state. Furthermore, when assessing optimal and suboptimal evolutions...

Abstract:
In optimal quantum-mechanical evolutions, motion can take place along paths of minimal length within an optimal time frame. Alternatively, optimal evolutions may occur along established paths without any waste of energy resources and achieving 100% speed efficiency. Unfortunately, realistic physical scenarios often lead to less-than-ideal evolutions that demonstrate suboptimal efficiency, nonzero curvature, and a high level of complexity. In this paper, we provide an exact analytical expression for the curvature of a quantum evolution pertaining to a two-level quantum system subjected to various time-dependent magnetic fields. Specifically, we examine the dynamics produced by a two-parameter nonstationary Hermitian Hamiltonian with unit speed efficiency. To enhance our understanding of the physical implications of the curvature coefficient, we analyze the curvature behavior in relation to geodesic efficiency, speed efficiency, and the complexity of the quantum evolution (as described by the ratio of the difference between accessible and accessed Bloch-sphere volumes for the evolution from initial to final state to the accessible volume for the given quantum evolution). Our findings indicate that, generally, efficient quantum evolutions exhibit lower complexity compared to inefficient ones. However, we also note that complexity transcends mere length. In fact, longer paths that are sufficiently curved can demonstrate a complexity that is less than that of shorter paths with a lower curvature coefficient.

Abstract:
Consider quantum channels with input dimension $d_1$, output dimension $d_2$ and Kraus rank at most $r$. Any such channel must satisfy the constraint $rd_2\geq d_1$, and the parameter regime $rd_2=d_1$ is called the boundary regime. In this paper, we show an optimal query lower bound $Ω(rd_1d_2/\varepsilon^2)$ for quantum channel tomography to within diamond norm error $\varepsilon$ in the away-from-boundary regime $rd_2\geq 2d_1$, matching the existing upper bound $O(rd_1d_2/\varepsilon^2)$. In particular, this lower bound fully settles the query complexity for the commonly studied case of equal input and output dimensions $d_1=d_2=d$ with $r\geq 2$, in sharp contrast to the unitary case $r=1$ where Heisenberg scaling $Θ(d^2/\varepsilon)$ is achievable.

Abstract:
Coupling mechanical motion to an optical resonator enables displacement measurements approaching the standard quantum limit (SQL). However, increasing the optomechanical coupling strength will inevitably lead to probing of the nonlinear response of the optical resonator. Thermal intermodulation noise (TIN) arising from the nonlinear mixing of thermomechanical motion can further increase the imprecision well above the SQL and has hitherto been canceled up to second order of nonlinearity via operation at the "magic detuning". In this work, we record the output of a membrane-in-the-middle microcavity system operating at room temperature and achieving high cooperativity, $C>n_\text{th}$, and apply a nonlinear transform that removes all orders of TIN, improving the mechanical signal-to-noise ratio by nearly 10 dB. Our results can be applied to experiments affected by third-order TIN, which we expect to be the dominating intrinsic source of noise in high-cooperativity room-temperature cavity optomechanical systems.

Abstract:
Dicke states serve as a critical resource in quantum metrology, communication, and computation. However, unitary preparation of Dicke states is limited to logarithmic depth in standard circuit models and existing constant-depth protocols require measurement and feed-forward. In this work, we present the first unitary, constant-depth protocols for exact Dicke state preparation. We overcome the logarithmic-depth barrier by moving beyond the standard circuit model and leveraging global interactions (native to architectures such as neutral atoms and trapped ions). Specifically, utilizing unbounded CZ gates (i.e. within the QAC$^0$ circuit class), we offer circuits for exact computation of constant-weight Dicke states, using polynomial ancillae, and approximation of weight-1 Dicke states (i.e. $W$ states), using only constant ancillae. Granted additional access to the quantum FAN-OUT operation (i.e. upgrading to the QAC$_f^0$ circuit class), we also achieve exact preparation of arbitrary-weight Dicke states, with polynomial ancillae. These protocols distinguish the constant-depth capabilities of quantum architectures based on connectivity and offer a novel path toward resolving a long-standing quantum complexity conjecture.

Abstract:
We exploit the variational and Hamiltonian structures of quantum hydrodynamics with spin to unfold the correlation and torque mechanisms accompanying spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in electronic motion. Using Hamilton's action principle for the Pauli equation, we isolate SOC-induced quantum forces that act on the orbital Madelung--Bohm trajectories and complement the usual force terms known to appear in quantum hydrodynamics with spin. While the latter spin-hydrodynamic forces relate to the quantum geometric tensor (QGT), SOC-induced orbital forces originate from a particular current operator that contributes prominently to the spin current and whose contribution was overlooked in the past. The distinction between different force terms reveals two fundamentally different mechanisms generating quantum spin-orbit correlations. Leveraging the Hamiltonian structure of the hydrodynamic system, we also elucidate spin transport features such as the current shift in the spin Hall effect and the correlation-induced quantum torques. Finally, we illustrate the framework via the Madelung--Rashba equations for planar SOC configurations and propose a particle-based scheme for numerical implementation.

Abstract:
While spin squeezing has been traditionally considered in all-to-all interacting models, recent works have shown that spin squeezing can occur in systems with power-law interactions, leading to direct testing in Rydberg atoms, trapped ions, ultracold atoms and nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. For the latter, Wu. et al. Nature 646 (2025) demonstrated that spin squeezing is heavily affected by positional disorder, reducing any capacity for a practical squeezing advantage, which requires scalability with the system size. In this Letter we explore the robustness of spin-squeezing in two-dimensional lattices with a fraction of unoccupied lattice sites. Using semi-classical modeling, we demonstrate the existence of scalable squeezing in power-law interacting XXZ models up to a disorder threshold, above which squeezing is not scalable. We produce a phase diagram for scalable squeezing, and explain its absence in the aforementioned NV experiment. Our work illustrates the maximum disorder allowed for realizing scalable spin squeezing in a host of quantum simulators, highlights a regime with substantial tolerance to disorder, and identifies controlled defect creation as a promising route for scalable squeezing in solid-state systems.

Abstract:
We introduce a quantum Maxwell erasure decoder for CSS quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes that extends peeling with bounded guessing. Guesses are tracked symbolically and can be eliminated by restrictive checks, giving a tunable tradeoff between complexity and performance via a guessing budget: an unconstrained budget recovers Maximum-Likelihood (ML) performance, while a constant budget yields linear-time decoding and approximates ML. We provide theoretical guarantees on asymptotic performance and demonstrate strong performance on bivariate bicycle and quantum Tanner codes.

Abstract:
We show that a robust, nonperturbative localization plateau emerges in periodically driven quasiperiodic lattices, independent of the static localization properties and drive protocol. Using exact Floquet dynamics, Floquet perturbation theory, and optimal-order van Vleck analysis, we identify a fine-tuned amplitude-to-frequency ratio where all Floquet states become localized despite dense resonances. The van Vleck expansion achieves superasymptotic accuracy up to an optimal orde; it ultimately breaks down due to resonant hybridization at a weak quasiperiodic potential, revealing that the observed localization is nonperturbative.

Abstract:
We investigate how a thermodynamical first-order phase transition affects the dynamical chaotic behaviour of a given model. To this effect, we analyze the model of Berkooz, Brukner, Jia and Mamroud that interpolates between the double-scaled SYK model and an integrable chord Hamiltonian. This model displays a first-order phase transition given by a kink in the free energy. We map out the dynamical behaviour, as characterized by chord number, Krylov complexity, and operator size, of the model across the phase diagram. We observe a jump in the chord numbers at the transition point, in agreement with the first-order transition. We further determine how scrambling measures, i.e.~the growth of the Lanczos coefficients and the time dependence of the operator size, change across the phase diagram. Deep inside the two phases, these measures indeed display integrable and chaotic behaviour, respectively. Across the transition however, we observe no qualitative change in these measures. This means that the thermodynamical transition does not imply a sharp transition in the growth exponent characterizing the dynamical chaotic behaviour. We also discuss a possible holographic interpretation of the model.

Abstract:
In this work, we describe optically inspired models for unitary black hole (BH) evaporation. The goal of these models are (i) to be operationally simple, (ii) approximately preserve the thermal nature of the emitted Hawking Radiation (HR), and (iii) attempt to reproduce the Page Curve that purports that information flows forth from the BH when it has evaporated to approximately half its initial mass. We concentrate on modeling the BH as a single mode squeezed state successively interacting, by means of beam splitters and squeezers, with vacuum modes near the horizon, giving rise to entangled pairs representing the external Hawking radiation and its partner particle inside the horizon. Since all states and operations are Gaussian throughout, we use a symplectic formalism to track the evolution of the composite system through the evolving means and variances of their quadrature operators. This allows us to easily compute correlations and entanglement between the BH and the HR, as well as calculate correlations between the BH at early and late times.

Abstract:
The classification of mixed-state topological order requires indices that behave monotonically under finite-depth quantum channels. In two dimensions, a braided $C^*$-tensor category, which corresponds to strong symmetry, arises from a state satisfying approximate Haag duality. In this note, we show that the $S$-matrix and topological twists of the braided $C^*$-tensor category are quantities that are monotone under finite-depth quantum channels.

Abstract:
Interface circuits are the key components that enable the hybrid integration of superconductor and semiconductor digital electronics. The design requirements of superconductor-semiconductor interface circuits vary depending on the application, such as high-performance classical computing, superconducting quantum computing, and digital signal processing. In this survey, various interface circuits are categorized based on the working principle and structure. The superconducting output drivers are explored, which are capable of converting and amplifying, e.g., single flux quantum (SFQ) voltage pulses, to voltage levels that semiconductor circuits can process. Several trade-offs between circuit- and system-level design parameters are examined. Accordingly, parameters such as the data rate, output voltage, power dissipation, layout area, thermal/heat load of cryogenic cables, and bit-error rate are considered.

Abstract:
A holographic entropy inequality (HEI) is a linear inequality obeyed by Ryu-Takayanagi holographic entanglement entropies, or equivalently by the minimum cut function on weighted graphs. We establish a new combinatorial framework for studying HEIs, and use it to prove several properties they share, including two majorization-related properties as well as a necessary and sufficient condition for an inequality to be an HEI. We thereby resolve all the conjectures presented in [arXiv:2508.21823], proving two of them and disproving the other two. In particular, we show that the null reduction of any superbalanced HEI passes the majorization test defined in [arXiv:2508.21823], thereby providing strong new evidence that all HEIs are obeyed in time-dependent holographic states.

Abstract:
Quantities computed by minimal cuts, such as entanglement entropies achievable by the Ryu-Takayanagi proposal in the AdS/CFT correspondence, are constrained by linear inequalities. We prove a previously conjectured property of all such constraints: Any $k$ systems on the "greater-than" side of the inequality are subsumed in some $k$ systems on its "less-than" side (accounting for multiplicity). This finding adds evidence that the same inequalities also constrain the entropies under time-dependent conditions because it preempts a large class of potential counterexamples. We prove several other properties of holographic entropy inequalities and comment on their relation to quantum erasure correction and the Renormalization Group.

Abstract:
Accurately capturing electron correlation in large-scale molecular systems remains one of the foremost challenges in quantum chemistry and a primary driver for the development of quantum algorithms. Classical configuration-interaction methods, while rigorous, suffer from exponential scaling, rendering them impractical for large or strongly correlated systems. Overcoming this limitation is central to realizing the promise of quantum computing in chemistry. Here, we investigate the pyridine-Li ion complex using three quantum algorithms: the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), the subspace quantum diagonalization (SQD) method, and the recently introduced handover iterative VQE (HI-VQE). Our results demonstrate how new generations of hybrid quantum-classical frameworks overcome the scalability and noise sensitivity that constrain conventional VQE approaches. SQD and HI-VQE achieve ground-state energy calculations for problem sizes inaccessible to classical computation, marking a clear advance toward quantum advantage. In particular, HI-VQE enables calculations within active spaces as large as (24e,22o), requiring 44 qubits-well beyond the reach of classical CASCI and VQE. This capability provides a systematic pathway for incorporating increasing numbers of electrons into quantum treatment, thereby approaching exact molecular energies. Importantly, both SQD and HI-VQE exhibit robustness against hardware noise, a critical improvement over earlier approaches. By enabling quantum simulations of molecular systems previously deemed intractable, SQD and HI-VQE offer a realistic route toward practical quantum advantage in computational chemistry. The comparison between HI-VQE and SQD shows that optimizing circuit parameters is crucial for accurate simulation.

Abstract:
We report microwave spectroscopy of Josephson junctions chains made from an epitaxial Al/InAs heterostructure. The chains exhibit superinductance, with characteristic wave impedance exceeding $R_{Q} = \hbar/(2e)^{2}$. The planar nature of the junctions results in a large plasma frequency, with no measurable deviations from ideal dispersion up to $12~\mathrm{GHz}$. Internal quality factors decrease sharply with frequency, which we describe with a simple loss model. The possibility of a loss mechanism intrinsic to the superconductor-semiconductor junction is considered.

Abstract:
Quasiperiodic systems host exotic transport regimes that are distinct from those found in periodic or disordered lattices. In this work, we study quantum transport in the Aubry-André-Harper lattice in a two-terminal setup coupled to zero-temperature reservoirs, where the conductance is evaluated via the nonequilibrium Green's function method. In the extended phase, we uncover a universal subdiffusive transport when the bath chemical potential aligns with the band edges. Specifically, the typical conductance displays a scaling of $\mathcal{G}_{\text{typ}}\sim L^{-2}$ with system size $L$. We attribute this behavior to the emergence of an exceptional point (Jordan normal form) in the transfer matrix in the thermodynamic limit. In the localized phase, the conductance shows exponential decay governed by the Lyapunov exponent. Intriguingly, in the critical phase, we identify pronounced log-periodic oscillations of the conductance as a function of system size, arising from the discrete scale invariance inherent to the singular-continuous spectrum. We further extend our analysis to the generalized Aubry-André-Harper model and provide numerical evidence suggesting that the exact mobility edge resides within a finite spectral gap. This results in a counter-intuitive exponential suppression of conductance precisely at the mobility edge. Our work highlights the distinct transport behaviors in quasiperiodic systems and elucidates how they are rigorously dictated by the underlying local spectral structure.

Abstract:
We study SU(3) gauge theory on small lattices in the minimal (qutrit) electric field truncation retaining only the ${\bf 1}, {\bf 3}, {\bf \overline{3}}$ representations for the link variables. Explicit expressions are given for the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian for the square plaquette chain and the two-dimensional honeycomb lattice. Our formalism can be easily extended to the minimally truncated general SU($N_c$) gauge theory. The addition of (static) quarks is discussed. We present results for the energy spectrum of the gauge field on these lattices by exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian and analyze its statistical properties. We also compute the SU(3) string tension and discuss how it is modified by vacuum fluctuations. Finally, we calculate the potential energies of a static quark-antiquark pair and three static quarks and study their screening at finite temperature.

Abstract:
Quantum chaotic systems exhibit certain universal statistical properties that closely resemble predictions from random matrix theory (RMT). With respect to observables, it has recently been conjectured that, when truncated to a sufficiently narrow energy window, their statistical properties can be described by an unitarily invariant ensemble, and testable criteria have been introduced, which are based on the scaling behavior of free cumulants. In this paper, we investigate the conjecture numerically in translationally invariant Heisenberg spin chains with spin quantum number $S =\frac{1}{2},1,\frac{3}{2}$. Combining a quantum-typicality-based numerical method with the exploitation of the system's symmetries, we study the spin current operator and find clear evidence of consistency with the proposed criteria in chaotic cases. Our findings further support the conjecture of the existence of RMT universality as manifest in the observable properties in quantum chaotic systems.

Abstract:
Experiments on Bose-Einstein condensates at finite temperature typically extract the system parameters, such as temperature, atom number, and condensed fraction from time-of-flight images taken after a free expansion time. This paper systematically examines the effect of repulsive interactions between the condensed and thermal atoms in partially condensed clouds on the expansion profile of the thermal cloud. An analytical expression for the expansion can be obtained only if the interactions between the Bose-Einstein condensate and thermal atoms are neglected, resulting in a Bose-enhanced distribution for the thermal component. Here, the deformation of the cloud due to interactions and the effects on estimated parameters are investigated by simulating the expansion using a ballistic approximation. By fitting the simulated expansion profiles with a Bose-enhanced distribution, the errors of using such a fit are estimated, and the results are explained phenomenologically. The simulation was also used as a fitting function for experimental data, showing better agreement of the extracted condensed fraction with the semi-ideal model than results from a Bose-enhanced fit.

Abstract:
We address the spatially nonlocal dielectric functions of graphene at any frequency derived starting fromthe first principles of thermal quantum field theory using the formalism of the polarization tensor. After a brief review of this formalism, the longitudinal and transverse dielectric functions are considered at any relationship between the frequency and the wave vector. The analytic properties of their real and imaginary parts are investigated at low and high frequencies. Emphasis is given to the double pole at zero frequency which arises in the transverse dielectric function. The role of this unusual property for solving the problem of disagreement between experiment and theory in the Casimir effect is discussed. We guess that a more complete dielectric response of ordinary metals should also be spatially nonlocal and its transverse part may possess the double pole in the region of evanescent waves.

Abstract:
We demonstrate a Doppler thermometer based on direct optical frequency comb spectroscopy of an $^{85}$Rb vapor with a chirped electro-optic frequency comb (EOFC). The direct EOFC Doppler thermometer is accurate to within its approximately 1 K statistical uncertainty. We experimentally compare direct EOFC spectroscopy with conventional Doppler spectroscopy using a single-frequency, step-scanned laser probe. Our results show that direct EOFC spectroscopy mitigates transit-induced optical pumping distortion of the atomic lineshape, which is the dominant systematic temperature shift in alkali atom Doppler thermometry. Optical Bloch equation simulations of conventional and direct EOFC Doppler spectroscopy confirm that EOFC spectroscopy can use higher optical power to reduce statistical noise without optical pumping distortion. Our results indicate that EOFC Doppler thermometry is a promising approach to realizing a primary thermometer with size and measurement rate sufficient for applications including pharmaceutical manufacturing and nuclear waste monitoring.

Abstract:
This work investigates the use of quantum resources in distributed storage systems. Consider an $(n,k,d)$ distributed storage system in which a file is stored across $n$ nodes such that any $k$ nodes suffice to reconstruct the file. When a node fails, any $d$ helper nodes transmit information to a newcomer to rebuild the system. In contrast to the classical repair, where helper nodes transmit classical bits, we allow them to send classical information over quantum channels to the newcomer. The newcomer then generates its storage by performing appropriate measurements on the received quantum states. In this setting, we fully characterize the fundamental tradeoff between storage and repair bandwidth (total communication cost). Compared to classical systems, the optimal storage--bandwidth tradeoff can be significantly improved with the enhancement of quantum entanglement shared only among the surviving nodes, particularly at the minimum-storage regenerating point. Remarkably, we show that when $d \geq 2k-2$, there exists an operating point at which \textit{both storage and repair bandwidth are simultaneously minimized}. This phenomenon breaks the tradeoff in the classical setting and reveals a fundamentally new regime enabled by quantum communication.

Abstract:
We investigate rotational state changes in a single collision of diatomic molecular ions, polar or apolar, with an atomic ion. Rotational state changes may occur since the angular degree of freedom of the molecular ions interacts with the electric field due to the atomic ion. Thanks to the very different time and energy scales of translational and rotational motion, we may treat the collision classically and describe only the rotations quantum mechanically. We first investigate a number of example systems numerically and then derive closed-form approximations for the rotational excitation per collision, depending on the scattering energy and the molecular parameters. These findings provide the basis for estimating the accumulated rotational excitation in sympathetic cooling of molecular ions by laser-cooled atomic ions [arXiv:2410.22458 ] which involves many single collisions.

Abstract:
We investigate a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation of the graph isomorphism problem using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). For small graph instances, we observe that isomorphic pairs exhibit consistent clustering in variational energies, indicating that the Hamiltonian successfully encodes structural features. However, we demonstrate that low variational energy alone is an unreliable certifier of isomorphism due to the high probability of converging to infeasible states that violate bijection constraints. To address this, we analyze optimization trajectories rather than final energies; consistently outperform naive energy thresholding, though absolute performance remains limited. Our results characterize the current limits of variational algorithms for graph isomorphism, positioning energy landscape analysis as a diagnostic tool rather than a scalable decision procedure in the NISQ regime.

Abstract:
Measurement incompatibility has proved to be an important resource for quantum information processing. In this work, we present an operational approach that leverages classical operations on the inputs (pre-processing) and outputs (post-processing) of measurement devices to explore different layers of incompatibility among the measurements performed by the device. We study classifications of measurement incompatibility with respect to these two types of classical operations, viz., post-processing or coarse-graining of measurement outcomes and pre-processing or convex-mixing of different measurements. We derive analytical criteria for determining when a set of projective measurements is fully incompatible with respect to coarse-graining or convex-mixing. Robustness against white noise for different layers of incompatibility for mutually unbiased bases is investigated. Furthermore, we study operational witnesses for incompatibility subject to these classical operations, using the input-output statistics of Bell-type experiments as well as experiments in the prepare-and-measure scenario.

Abstract:
Cluster states and graph states in general offer a useful model of the stabilizer formalism and a path toward the development of measurement-based quantum computation. Their defining structure - the stabilizer group - encodes all possible correlations that can be observed during measurement. The measurement outcomes which are consistent with the stabilizer structure make error correction possible. Here, we leverage both properties to design feasible families of states that can be used as robust building blocks of quantum computation. This procedure reduces the effect of experimentally relevant noise models on the extraction of smaller entangled states from the larger noisy graph state. In particular, we study the extraction of Bell pairs from linearly extended graph states - this has the immediate consequence for state teleportation across the graph. We show that robust entanglement can be extracted by proper design of the linear graph with only a minimal overhead of the physical qubits. This scenario is relevant to systems in which the entanglement can be created between neighboring sites. The results shown in this work provide a mathematical framework for noise reduction in measurement-based quantum computation. With proper connectivity structures, the effect of noise can be minimized for a large class of realistic noise processes.

Abstract:
Recent theoretical results in quantum machine learning have demonstrated a general trade-off between the expressive power of quantum neural networks (QNNs) and their trainability; as a corollary of these results, practical exponential separations in expressive power over classical machine learning models are believed to be infeasible as such QNNs take a time to train that is exponential in the model size. We here circumvent these negative results by constructing a hierarchy of efficiently trainable QNNs that exhibit unconditionally provable, polynomial memory separations of arbitrary constant degree over classical neural networks -- including state-of-the-art models, such as Transformers -- in performing a classical sequence modeling task. This construction is also computationally efficient, as each unit cell of the introduced class of QNNs only has constant gate complexity. We show that contextuality -- informally, a quantitative notion of semantic ambiguity -- is the source of the expressivity separation, suggesting that other learning tasks with this property may be a natural setting for the use of quantum learning algorithms.

Abstract:
We propose a quantum model consisting of an ensemble of overdamped spin$-1/2$ particles with ferromagnetic couplings, driven by a radially homogeneous magnetic field. The spontaneous magnetization of the spin components breaks the $SO(3)$ (or $SO(2)$) symmetry, inducing an ordered phase of flocking. Our model converges to the Vicsek model in the classical limit and corresponds to the Toner-Tu model in the continuous limit. Our investigation not only elucidates the intrinsic connection between these two models, but also introduces new opportunities for exploring the mechanisms underlying flocking order and correlations at the quantum level, which maybe pave the way for a new field of research -- the quantum active matter.

Abstract:
In hypothesis testing with quantum states, given a black box containing one of the two possible states, measurement is performed to detect in favor of one of the hypotheses. In postselected hypothesis testing, a third outcome is added, corresponding to not selecting any of the hypotheses. In postselected scenario, minimum error one-shot symmetric hypothesis testing is characterized in literature conditioned on the fact that one of the selected outcomes occur. We proceed further in this direction to give the set of all possible measurements that lead to the minimum error. We have given an arbitrary error-minimizing measurement in a parametric form. Note that not selecting any of the hypotheses decimates the quality of testing. We further give an example to show that these measurements vary in quality. There is a need to discuss the quality of postselected hypothesis testing. We then characterize the quality of postselected hypothesis testing by defining a new metric acceptance and give expression of acceptance for an arbitrary error-minimizing measurement in terms of some parameters of the measurement. On the set of measurements that achieve minimum error, we have maximized the acceptance, and given an example which achieves that, thus giving an example of the best possible measurement in terms of acceptance.

Abstract:
The problem of determining the existence of a spectral gap in a lattice quantum spin system was previously shown to be undecidable for one [J. Bausch et al., "Undecidability of the spectral gap in one dimension", Physical Review X 10 (2020)] or more dimensions [T. S. Cubitt et al., "Undecidability of the spectral gap", Nature 528 (2015)]. In these works, families of nearest-neighbor interactions are constructed whose spectral gap depends on the outcome of a Turing machine Halting problem, therefore making it impossible for an algorithm to predict its existence. While these models are translationally invariant, they are not invariant under the other symmetries of the lattice, a property which is commonly found in physically relevant cases. This poses the question of whether the spectral gap problem could be decidable for Hamiltonians with stronger symmetry constraints. We give a negative answer to this question, in the case of models with 4-body (plaquette) interactions on the square lattice satisfying rotation, but not reflection, symmetry: rotational symmetry is not enough to make the problem decidable.

Abstract:
Sympathetic cooling of molecular ions through the Coulomb interaction with laser-cooled atomic ions is an efficient tool to prepare translationally cold molecules without, ideally, affecting the internal state of the molecular ions. However, the electric field due to the Coulomb interaction may induce rotational transitions that change the purity of initially quantum state prepared molecules. Here, we use estimates of rotational state changes in single collisions of diatomic ions with atomic ions [arXiv:1905.02130] to determine the overall rotational excitation accumulated over the sympathetic cooling. Considering two different experimental scenarios, that of a molecular ion co-trapped with a single atomic ion and a molecular ion immersed in a Coulomb crystal of atomic ions, we also estimate the cooling time.

Abstract:
Quantum memories are a crucial precondition in many protocols for processing quantum information. A fundamental problem that illustrates this statement is given by the task of channel discrimination, in which an unknown channel drawn from a known random ensemble should be determined by applying it for a single time. In this paper, we characterise the quality of channel discrimination protocols when the quantum memory, quantified by the auxiliary dimension, is limited. This is achieved by formulating the problem in terms of separable quantum states with additional affine constraints that all of their factors in each separable decomposition obey. We discuss the computation of upper and lower bounds to the solutions of such problems which allow for new insights into the role of memory in channel discrimination. In addition to the single-copy scenario, this methodological insight allows to systematically characterise quantum and classical memories in adaptive channel discrimination protocols. Especially, our methods enabled us to identify channel discrimination scenarios where classical or quantum memory is required, and to identify the hierarchical and non-hierarchical relationships within adaptive channel discrimination protocols.

Abstract:
For many problems, quantum algorithms promise speedups over their classical counterparts. However, these results predominantly rely on asymptotic worst-case analysis, which overlooks significant overheads due to error correction and the fact that real-world instances often contain exploitable structure. In this work, we employ the hybrid benchmarking method to evaluate the potential of quantum Backtracking and Grover's algorithm against the 2023 SAT competition main track winner in solving random $k$-SAT instances with tunable structure, designed to represent industry-like scenarios, using both $T$-depth and $T$-count as cost metrics to estimate quantum run times. Our findings reproduce the results of Campbell, Khurana, and Montanaro (Quantum '19) in the unstructured case using hybrid benchmarking. However, we offer a more sobering perspective in practically relevant regimes: almost all quantum speedups vanish, even asymptotically, when minimal structure is introduced or when $T$-count is considered instead of $T$-depth. Moreover, when the requirement is for the algorithm to find a solution within a single day, we find that only Grover's algorithm has the potential to outperform classical algorithms, but only in a very limited regime and only when using $T$-depth. We also discuss how more sophisticated heuristics could restore the asymptotic scaling advantage for quantum backtracking, but our findings suggest that the potential for practical quantum speedups in more structured $k$-SAT solving will remain limited.

Abstract:
Understanding the limitations imposed by noise on current and next-generation quantum devices is a crucial step towards demonstrating practical quantum advantage. In this work, we investigate the accumulation of entropy density as a benchmark to monitor the performance of quantum processing units. We provide a proof-of-principle demonstration of our novel methodology which entails developing simple heuristic models of how entropy accumulates, testing them against real QPU experiments, and finally using these models to determine a circuit volume threshold above which quantum advantage is unattainable. Monitoring entropy density not only offers a novel approach that complements existing circuit-level benchmarking techniques, but more importantly, it bridges the gap between circuit-level and application-level benchmarking protocols. In particular, our heuristic model of entropy accumulation allows us to outperform existing techniques that bound the circuit size threshold for quantum advantage.

Abstract:
Based on the well-known Tavis-Cummings (TC) model of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), we introduce a method for quantum-mechanically simulating the dynamics of experimental masers beyond the mean-field approximation (MFA) that takes into account the spatial variation of the a.c. magnetic field of the maser's amplified microwave mode across its gain medium. The distribution in the coupling between the amplified mode and the medium's very large number (typically $10^{17}$) of spatially distributed quantum emitters can be determined straightforwardly for a given geometry and composition using an electromagnetic-field solver. Upon discretising this distribution as a histogram over a small finite number of bins, we assign -- as an approximation -- the same coupling to all emitters that fall within the same bin, where the value of this coupling equals the center value of the bin's range. With our approximate Hamiltonian arranged as a weighted sum over these bins, we generate expressions for expectation values of operators in the Heisenberg picture to second order in cumulant expansion, using the publicly available QuantumCumulants.jl package in Julia. For ten evenly spaced bins, our model, which can be run on a laptop computer, is used to simulate the recorded output from an experimental maser with a pentacene-doped para-terphenyl gain medium. We find that it replicates the quantum-mechanical features of the measured maser's dynamics, in particular its damped collective Rabi oscillations, more closely than the standard TC model under the MFA can, with an R$^2$ value of 0.774, as opposed to 0.265. Our model should thus aid the quantitative engineering of improved, optimised maser designs.

Abstract:
We show that encrypted cloning of unknown quantum states is possible. Any number of encrypted clones of a qubit can be created through a unitary transformation, and each of the encrypted clones can be decrypted through a unitary transformation. The decryption of an encrypted clone consumes the decryption key, i.e., only one decryption is possible, in agreement with the no-cloning theorem. Encrypted cloning represents a new paradigm that provides a form of redundancy, parallelism or scalability where direct duplication is forbidden by the no-cloning theorem. For example, a possible application of encrypted cloning is to enable encrypted quantum multi-cloud storage.

Abstract:
The optimal quantum measurements for estimating different unknown parameters in a parameterized quantum state are usually incompatible with each other. Traditional approaches to addressing the measurement incompatibility issue, such as the Holevo Cramér--Rao bound, suffer from multiple difficulties towards practical applicability, as the optimal measurement strategies are usually state-dependent, difficult to implement and also take complex analyses to determine. Here we study randomized measurements as a new approach for multi-parameter quantum metrology. We show quantum measurements on single copies of quantum states given by $3$-designs perform near-optimally when estimating an arbitrary number of parameters in pure states and more generally, {approximately low-rank well-conditioned states}, whose metrological information is largely concentrated in a low-dimensional subspace. The near-optimality is also shown in estimating the maximal number of parameters for three types of mixed states that are well-conditioned on their supports. Examples of fidelity estimation and Hamiltonian estimation are explicitly provided to demonstrate the power and limitation of randomized measurements in multi-parameter quantum metrology.

Abstract:
Logical consistency with free local operations is compatible with non-trivial classical communications, where all parties can be both in each other's past and future-a phenomenon known as noncausality. Noncausal processes, such as the "Lugano (AF/BW) process", violate causal inequalities, yet their physical realizability remains an open question. In contrast, the quantum switch-a physically realizable process with indefinite causal order-can only generate causal correlations. Building on a recently established correspondence [Kunjwal & Baumeler, PRL 131, 120201 (2023)] between the SHIFT measurement, which exhibits nonlocality without entanglement, and the Lugano process, we demonstrate that the SHIFT measurement can be implemented using a quantum switch of classical communications in a scenario with quantum inputs. This shows that the structure of the Lugano process can be simulated by a quantum switch and that successful SHIFT discrimination witnesses causal nonseparability rather than noncausality. Finally, we identify a broad class of "superposition of classical communications" derived from classical processes without global past capable of realizing similar causally indefinite measurements. We examine these results in relation to the ongoing debate on implementations of indefinite causal orders.

Abstract:
Protected superconducting qubits such as the $0$-$π$ qubit promise to substantially reduce physical error rates. However, a key challenge in the field is designing gates for these qubits that do not compromise their protection, or become infeasibly slow as the protection of the qubit is improved. In this work we propose a protected phase gate that is compatible with the protected regime of the $0$-$π$ qubit, and does not suffer from spurious coupling to additional circuit modes. Our gate utilises an internal mode of the circuit as an ancilla, and is achieved by varying the qubit-ancilla coupling via a tunable Josephson element. Through numerical simulations, we study how the gate error scales with the circuit parameters of the $0$-$π$ qubit and the tunable Josephson element that enacts the gate. Ultimately, we find that a protected gate with the $0$-$π$ qubit is possible with near-term circuit parameters. Our work opens up the possibility of performing protected gates on protected superconducting qubits, which may significantly reduce hardware overheads for quantum computation.

Abstract:
Silicon is the foundation of current information technology, and a promising platform for future quantum information technology as silicon-based qubits exhibit some of the longest coherence times in solid-state. At the same time, silicon is the underlying material for advanced photonics activity, and photonics structures in silicon can be used to define optomechanical cavities where the vibrations of nanoscale mechanical resonators can be probed down to the quantum level with laser light. Here, we propose to bring all these developments together by coupling silicon donor spins into optomechanical structures. We show theoretically and numerically that this allows telecom wavelength optical readout of the spin-qubits and implementing high-fidelity entangling two-qubit gates between donor spins that are spatially separated by tens of micrometers. We present an optimized geometry of the proposed device and discuss with the help of numerical simulations the predicted performance of the proposed quantum bus. We analyze the optomechanical spin readout fidelity and find the optimal donor species for different coupling mechanisms.

Abstract:
In classical systems, the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theorem establishes that resonant tori of integrable Hamiltonians are destroyed by any nonintegrable perturbation, whereas nonresonant tori are only deformed up to a finite value of the perturbation parameter. In this contribution, we identify a quantum analog of this differentiated sensitivity for one-degree-of-freedom spin Hamiltonians subject to periodic instantaneous kicks. After detecting quantum signatures of resonances in the participation ratio and in the quasiprobability phase-space distribution of Floquet eigenstates of the perturbed Hamiltonian, we show that eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian exhibit greater sensitivity against the perturbation when they satisfy a resonant condition. The sensitivity is quantified through the fidelity between perturbed and unperturbed eigenstates. This differentiated sensitivity becomes increasingly pronounced as the system size grows. Our findings are supported by numerical results and insights from analytical calculations based on unitary perturbation theory. Although our analysis focuses on kicked models, the mechanism could be extended to more general periodic drivings, providing a preliminary step toward a quantum counterpart of the classical breaking of resonant tori.

Abstract:
Quantum systems that interact non-locally with an environment are paradigms for exploring collective phenomena. They naturally emerge in various physical contexts involving long-range, many-body interactions. We consider a general class of such open systems characterized by a coupling to the environment which is inversely proportional to the square root of the environment size. We show that the induced system dynamics has a universal bosonic nature: the same evolution arises from coupling the system to a collection of noninteracting bosonic modes, independently of the microscopic structure of the original environment. This emergent "bosonization" of the environment's influence results from the scaling of the coupling in the thermodynamic limit and is a manifestation of the quantum central limit theorem. While the effect has been observed in specific models before, we show that it is, in fact, a universal feature.

Abstract:
The conditional disclosure of secrets (CDS) setting is among the most basic primitives studied in information-theoretic cryptography. Motivated by a connection to non-local quantum computation and position-based cryptography, CDS with quantum resources has recently been considered. Here, we study the differences between quantum and classical CDS, with the aims of clarifying the power of quantum resources in information-theoretic cryptography. We establish the following results:   1) We prove a $Ω(\log \mathsf{R}_{0,A\rightarrow B}(f)+\log \mathsf{R}_{0,B\rightarrow A}(f))$ lower bound on quantum CDS where $\mathsf{R}_{0,A\rightarrow B}(f)$ is the classical one-way communication complexity with perfect correctness.   2) We prove a lower bound on quantum CDS in terms of two round, public coin, two-prover interactive proofs.   3) For perfectly correct CDS, we give a separation for a promise version of the not-equals function, showing a quantum upper bound of $O(\log n)$ and classical lower bound of $Ω(n)$.   4) We give a logarithmic upper bound for quantum CDS on forrelation, while the best known classical algorithm is linear. We interpret this as preliminary evidence that classical and quantum CDS are separated even with correctness and security error allowed.   We also give a separation for classical and quantum private simultaneous message passing for a partial function, improving on an earlier relational separation. Our results use novel combinations of techniques from non-local quantum computation and communication complexity.

Abstract:
This study establishes a universal mechanism for entropy production in isolated quantum systems governed by interactions that induce random-phase fluctuations. By developing a resolvent-based framework, we demonstrate that steady-state entropy generically arises from many-body interactions, independent of specific coupling details, provided the coherent accumulation of systematic biases does not overwhelm the random-phase fluctuations. Analytical arguments reveal that entropy generation is driven by two universal pathways: interaction-induced energy broadening and temporal coarse-graining over exponentially small energy gaps. To quantitatively capture the probability distribution, we introduce a hierarchical ansatz approach. A Lorentzian ansatz models the bulk region, leading to self-consistent equations for the broadening and shift parameters, and yields a logarithmic entropy scaling with interaction strength. For the tail behavior, a Gaussian ansatz is formulated, and the corresponding self-consistent condition is derived and validated. By further combining these profiles into an enhanced Lorentzian-Gaussian hybrid ansatz, we achieve a unified and refined description of the full distribution. Numerical simulations of nonintegrable Ising spin chains confirm the predicted logarithmic entropy scaling and validate the self-consistent equations. Our framework effectively bridges the concepts of observational entropy and von Neumann entropy dynamics, providing predictive tools for thermodynamic behavior in quantum many-body systems. These results resolve longstanding debates about interaction-dependent entropy scaling and offer pathways for entropy control in quantum technologies.

Abstract:
Symmetries are a key tool in understanding quantum systems, and, among many other things, can be exploited to increase the efficiency of numerical simulations of quantum dynamics. Disordered systems usually feature reduced symmetries and additionally require averaging over many realizations, making their numerical study computationally demanding. However, when studying quantities linear in the time-evolved state, i.e. expectation values of observables, one can apply the averaging procedure to the time evolution operator, resulting in an effective dynamical map, which restores symmetry at the level of superoperators. In this work, we develop schemes for efficiently constructing symmetric sectors of the disorder-averaged dynamical map using short-time and weak-disorder expansions. To benchmark the method, we apply it to an Ising model with random all-to-all interactions in the presence of a transverse field. After disorder averaging, this system becomes effectively permutation-invariant, and thus the size of the symmetric subspace scales polynomially in the number of spins allowing for the simulation of large systems.

Abstract:
Quantum Monte Carlo integration, a quantum algorithm for calculating expectations that provides a quadratic speed-up compared to its classical counterpart, is now attracting increasing interest in the context of its industrial and scientific applications. In this paper, we propose the first application of QMCI to solving McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (MVSDEs), a nonlinear class of SDEs whose drift and diffusion coefficients depend on the law $μ_t$ of the solution $X_t$ -- appearing in fields such as finance and fluid mechanics. We focus on the problem setting where the coefficients depend on $μ_t$ through expectations of some functions $\mathbb{E}[\varphi_k(X_t)]$, and the goal is to compute the expectation of a function $\mathbb{E}[φ(X_T)]$ at a terminal time $T$. We devise a quantum algorithm that leverages QMCI to compute these expectations, combined with a high-order time discretization method for SDEs and extrapolation of the expectations in time. The proposed algorithm estimates $\mathbb{E}[φ(X_T)]$ with accuracy $ε$, making $O(1/ε^{1+2/p})$ queries to the quantum circuit for time evolution over one step, where $p\in(1,2]$ is the weak order of the SDE discretization method. This demonstrates the speed-up over the well-known classical algorithm called the particle method with complexity of $O(1/ε^3)$. We conduct a numerical demonstration of our quantum algorithm applied to an example of MVSDEs, with some parts emulated classically, and observe that the accuracy and complexity behave as expected.

Abstract:
Inspired by the close relationship between Kolmogorov complexity and unsupervised machine learning, we explore quantum circuit complexity, an important concept in quantum computation and quantum information science, as a pivot to understand and to build interpretable and efficient unsupervised machine learning for topological order in quantum many-body systems. We argue that Nielsen's quantum circuit complexity represents an intrinsic topological distance between topological quantum many-body phases of matter, and as such plays a central role in interpretable manifold learning of topological order. To span a bridge from conceptual power to practical applicability, we present two theorems that connect Nielsen's quantum circuit complexity for the quantum path planning between two arbitrary quantum many-body states with quantum Fisher complexity (Bures distance) and entanglement generation, respectively. Leveraging these connections, fidelity-based and entanglement-based similarity measures or kernels, which are more practical for implementation, are formulated. Using the two proposed distance measures, unsupervised manifold learning of quantum phases of the bond-alternating XXZ spin chain, the ground state of Kitaev's toric code and random product states, is conducted, demonstrating their superior performance. Moreover, we find that the entanglement-based approach, which captures the long-range structure of quantum entanglement of topological orders, is more robust to local Haar random noises. Relations with classical shadow tomography and shadow kernel learning are also discussed, where the latter can be naturally understood from our approach. Our results establish connections between key concepts and tools of quantum circuit computation, quantum complexity, quantum metrology, and machine learning of topological quantum order.

Abstract:
We reveal the noncyclic Pancharatnam phase--arising from the coherent system-meter interaction--as a fundamental criterion that governs the optimal performance of quantum compression channels in postselected metrology. This phase embodies a geometric connection that enables precise control over the parallel evolution of the meter state, thereby maximizing the quantum Fisher information per trial and achieving lossless compression channels. Remarkably, fine-tuning the postselection parameter just below this optimal phase incurs substantial information loss, whereas tuning it just above fully suppresses undesired parallel evolution, enhancing information retention beyond that achievable in postselected protocols lacking Pancharatnam phase effects. We further reveal that leveraging qudit meter states can unlock a substantial additional enhancement. These findings establish the Pancharatnam phase as a geometric benchmark, guiding the design of high-precision quantum parameter estimation protocols.

Abstract:
Control is a fundamental concept in quantum and reversible computational models. It enables the conditional application of a transformation to a system, depending on the state of another system. We introduce a general framework for diagrammatic reasoning featuring control as a constructor. To this end, we provide an elementary axiomatisation of control functors, extending the standard formalism of props to controlled props. As an application, we show that controlled props facilitate diagrammatic reasoning for quantum circuits by introducing a simple and complete set of relations involving at most three qubits, whereas in the standard prop setting any complete axiomatisation necessarily requires relations acting on arbitrarily many qubits.

Abstract:
The dark-state effect, caused by destructive quantum interference, is an important physical effect in atomic physics and quantum optics. It not only deepens the understanding of light-atom interactions, but also has wide applications in quantum physics and quantum information. Therefore, how to efficiently and conveniently determine the number and form of the dark states in multilevel quantum systems with complex transitions is an important and interesting topic in this field. In this work, we present a general theory for determining the dark states in multilevel quantum systems with any coupling configuration using the arrowhead-matrix method. To confirm the dark states in a multilevel system, we first define the upper- and lower-state subspaces, and then diagonalize the Hamiltonians restricted within the two subspaces to obtain the dressed upper and lower states. By further expressing the transitions between the dressed upper and lower states, we can map the multilevel system to a bipartite-graph network, in which the nodes and links are acted by the dressed states and transitions, respectively. Based on the coupling configurations of the network, we can determine the lower dark states with respect to the upper-state subspace. As examples, we analyze the dark states in three-, four-, and five-level quantum systems, for all possible configurations through the classification of the numbers of upper and lower states. Furthermore, we extend the framework to multilevel quantum systems and discuss the existence of dark states in some typical configurations. We also recover the results of the dark-state polaritons in driven three-level systems with the arrowhead-matrix method. Our theory paves the way for manipulating and utilizing the dark states of multilevel quantum systems in atomic physics and quantum optics.

Abstract:
We present a protocol for preparing oscillator states with $n$-fold rotational symmetry, which include many logical codewords for bosonic quantum error correction codes. The protocol relies on a multiphoton interaction between the oscillator and an auxiliary qubit. Further, we achieve arbitrary control over the oscillator's Hilbert space by using a combination of different multiphoton interaction orders. We also discuss the preparation of rotationally symmetric multi-oscillator states using a generalized variant of the protocol. We show that the use of multiphoton qubit-oscillator interactions can substantially reduce the state preparation time, in comparison to the linear qubit-oscillator interactions that are usually employed. Furthermore, we perform numerical simulations that take into account qubit and oscillator relaxation and dephasing using realistic planar superconducting circuit parameters that validate the robustness of our protocol. Our findings can significantly improve the performance of bosonic codes on planar superconducting hardware, which are an almost inevitable necessity for scalable bosonic fault-tolerant superconducting quantum computers.

Abstract:
Quantum information tasks are often analyzed under varying trust assumptions about the devices involved. The semi-device-independent (SDI) framework offers a balance between needed assumptions and experimental feasibility. In this work, we study the energy-constrained SDI scenario, where the only assumption in a prepare-and-measure setup is an upper bound on the energy of the prepared quantum states. In contrast to previous studies that restricted the preparation and measurement devices to be classically correlated, we show that allowing entanglement strictly enlarges the set of achievable correlations. We identify two operational consequences of this result. The first concerns randomness certification, where we show that allowing the adversary to employ entangled strategies may significantly reduce the amount of certifiable randomness. This includes situations where the amount of randomness drops to zero in the presence of entanglement, while it remains positive when entanglement is excluded. Second, for the task of distinguishing an arbitrary quantum channel from the identity, we show that the known dimension-independent bound on the advantage conferred by entanglement is violated under an energy constraint.

Abstract:
Quantum Mpemba effect describes an anomalous phenomenon of accelerated relaxation which is of fundamental interest in the field of nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Conventional theories on this phenomenon strongly rely on the Born-Markovian approximation resulting in a Lindblad-type master equation whose evolution is governed by a Liouvillian superoperator. It has been demonstrated that exceptional points of the Liouvillian superoperator can induce the Mpemba effect in Markovian regimes. Moving beyond this Markovian limit, we here propose a mechanism for realizing the quantum Mpemba effect in a general non-Markovian relaxation process by means of non-Markovian exceptional points. We verify the feasibility of this mechanism within a dissipative quantum harmonic oscillator model, which is exactly solvable and experimentally practical. Providing new insight into the interesting non-equilibrium dynamics, our work paves a way to accelerate the transfer of energy and information in quantum systems.

Abstract:
We propose quantum-mechanical systems in which the number of spatial dimensions is promoted to a dynamical quantum variable, making the effective dimension state-dependent. Interestingly, systems of this form can exhibit enhanced symmetries compared to their fixed-dimensional counterparts. As an explicit example, we analyze a two-state system for which the number of spatial dimensions is represented by a quantum operator. By evaluating the corresponding partition function, we uncover a temperature-dependent effective dimension. Our framework opens a new avenue for constructing physical systems, from gravity to condensed matter, where the very notion of dimensionality becomes quantum.

Abstract:
In the framework of the so-called quasi-Hermitian quantum mechanics of stationary unitary systems, bound states are usually constructed as eigenstates $|ψ_n \rangle$ of a Hamiltonian operator $H$ with real spectrum which is non-Hermitian, $H \neq H^\dagger$. One of the ways of the standard probabilistic interpretation of such systems consists in a transformation of $H$ into its isospectral Hermitian ``twin" $\mathfrak{h}= \mathfrak{h}^\dagger$ via one of the so-called Dyson maps $Ω: H \to \mathfrak{h}$. Naturally, the well known ambiguity of these $H-$dependent Dyson-map transformations implies also an ambiguity of the physical, $Ω-$dependent probabilistic and experimental interpretation of the system in question. In the present paper, an exhaustive classification of all of the eligible $H-$dependent Dyson maps $Ω=Ω(H)$ is provided, implying also a systematic framework for a specification of all of the possible probabilistic interpretations of the quantum system characterized by a preselected $H$.

Abstract:
Fault-tolerant quantum computation using surface codes relies on efficient scheduling of non-Clifford operations, realized via the injection of magic states produced through a probabilistic process that dominates spacetime costs. Existing scheduling approaches use dedicated bus qubits for routing and separate peripheral ancilla qubit factories for magic state preparation, leading to inefficient resource utilization. With the advent of magic state cultivation, preparation qubits can be placed anywhere within the surface code architecture. We introduce Pure Magic scheduling, which dynamically re-purposes magic state cultivation qubits for routing operations, eliminating dedicated bus infrastructure. By interrupting cultivation when qubits are needed for routing, Pure Magic naturally favors shorter cultivation times while ensuring no ancilla qubit remains idle. Our evaluation across 17 benchmark circuits improves scheduling efficiency by 19% to 223% compared to traditional bus routing and decreases average magic state preparation time by 2.6x to 9.7x. Benefits scale with circuit parallelism, making Pure Magic particularly valuable for highly parallel quantum algorithms. The Pure Magic architecture represents a paradigm shift from static to dynamic, demand-driven scheduling in fault-tolerant quantum architectures.

In a second part of the paper, I show how von Neumann's work on infinite direct products provides a theoretical framework that deflates the measurement problem and justifies Bohr's insistence on the primacy of classical concepts.

Abstract:
Parametrically driven oscillators can emerge as a basis for the next generation of qubits. Classically, these systems exhibit two stable oscillatory states with opposite phases. Upon quantization, these states turn into a pair of closely spaced Floquet states, which can serve as the logical basis for a qubit. However, interaction with the environment induces phase-slip events which set a limit on qubit coherence. Such phase slips persist even at zero temperature due to a mechanism known as quantum activation \cite{QuantumActivation}. In contrast to conventional tunneling, the quantum activation is described by a {\em real-time} instanton trajectory in the complexified phase space of the system. In this work, we show that the phase-slip rate is exponentially sensitive to weak AC perturbations. The spectrum of the system's response -- captured by the so-called logarithmic susceptibility (LS) -- enables a direct observation of characteristic features of real-time instantons. Studying this spectrum suggests new means of efficient qubit control.

Abstract:
In this work, we discuss a non-Hermitian system described via a one-dimensional single-particle tight-binding model, where the non-Hermiticity is governed by random nearest-neighbour tunnellings, such that the left-to-right and right-to-left hopping strengths are unequal. A physical situation of completely real eigenspectrum arises owing to the Hamiltonian's tridiagonal matrix structure under a simple sign conservation of the product of the conjugate nearest-neighbour tunnelling terms. The off-diagonal disorder leads the non-Hermitian system to a delocalization-localization crossover in finite systems. The emergent nature of the crossover is recognized through a finite-size spectral analysis. The system enters into a localized phase for infinitesimal disorder strength in the thermodynamic limit. We perform a careful scaling analysis of localization length, inverse participation ratio (IPR), and energy splitting and report the corresponding scaling exponents. Noticeably, in contrast to the diagonal disorder, the density of states (DOS) has a singularity at E=0 in the presence of the off-diagonal disorder and the corresponding wavefunction remains delocalized for any given disorder strength.

Abstract:
Optomechanical systems using a membrane-in-the-middle configuration can exhibit a long-range type of interaction similar to how atoms show collective motion in an optical potential. Photons bounce back and forth inside a high-finesse Fabry-Pérot cavity and mediate the interaction between multiple membranes over a significant distance compared to the wavelength. Recently, it has been demonstrated that off-resonant coupling between light and the inter-membrane cavity can lead to coherent mechanical noise cancellation. On-resonance coupling of light with both the Fabry-Pérot and inter-membrane cavities, predicted to enhance the single photon optomechanical coupling, have to date not been experimentally demonstrated, however. In our experiment, a double-membrane system inside a Fabry-Pérot cavity resonantly enhances the cavity field, resulting in a stronger optomechanical coupling strength from the increased radiation pressure. The resonance condition is first identified by analyzing the slope of the dispersion relation. Then, the optomechanical coupling is determined at various chip positions over one wavelength range. The optimum coupling conditions are obtained and enhancement is demonstrated for double membrane arrays with three different reflectivites, reaching nearly four-fold enhancement for the collective motion of $R=65\%$ double membranes. The cavity losses at the optimum coupling are also characterized and the potential of reaching the single-photon strong coupling regime is discussed.

Abstract:
The significant progress of quantum sensing technologies offer numerous radical solutions for measuring a multitude of physical quantities at an unprecedented precision. Among them, Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQRs) emerge as an eminent solution for detecting the electric field of radio frequency (RF) signals, exhibiting great potential in assisting classical wireless communications and sensing. So far, most experimental studies have aimed for the proof of physical concepts to reveal its promise, while the practical signal model of RAQR-aided wireless communications and sensing remained under-explored. Furthermore, the performance of RAQR-based wireless receivers and their advantages over classical RF receivers have not been fully characterized. To fill these gaps, we introduce the RAQR to the wireless community by presenting an end-to-end reception scheme. We then develop a corresponding equivalent baseband signal model relying on a realistic reception flow. Our scheme and model provide explicit design guidance to RAQR-aided wireless systems. We next study the performance of RAQR-aided wireless systems based on our model, and compare them to classical RF receivers. The results show that Doppler broadening-free RAQRs are capable of achieving a substantial received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain of over $27$ decibel (dB) and $40$ dB in the photon shot limit and standard quantum limit regimes, respectively.

Abstract:
We introduce a hydrodynamic framework for describing monitored classical stochastic processes. We study the conditional ensembles for these monitored processes -- i.e., we compute spacetime correlation functions conditioned on a fixed, typical measurement record. In the presence of global symmetries we show that these conditional ensembles can undergo measurement-induced "sharpening" phase transitions as a function of the monitoring rate; moreover, even weak monitoring can give rise to novel critical phases, derived entirely from a classical perspective. We give a simple hydrodynamic derivation of the known "charge-fuzzy phase" for weakly monitored diffusive many-body quantum systems. We show that although the unmonitored symmetric and asymmetric exclusion processes are in different universality classes of transport, the fluctuations in their conditional ensembles flow to the same fixed point with emergent relativistic invariance under monitoring. On the other hand, weakly monitored systems with non-Abelian symmetries enter a novel strongly coupled fixed point with non-trivial dynamical exponent, which we characterize. Our formalism naturally accounts for monitoring general observables, such as currents or density gradients, and allows for a direct calculation of information-theoretic diagnostics of sharpening transitions, including the Shannon entropy of the measurement record.

Abstract:
Conformal interfaces play an important role in quantum critical systems. In closed systems, the transmission properties of conformal interfaces are typically characterized by two quantities: One is the effective central charge $c_{\text{eff}}$, which measures the amount of quantum entanglement through the interface, and the other is the transmission coefficient $c_{\text{LR}}$, which measures the energy transmission through the interface. In the present work, to characterize the transmission property of conformal interfaces in open quantum systems, we propose a third quantity $c_{\text{relax}}$, which is defined through the ratio of Liouvillian gaps with and without an interface. Physically, $c_{\text{relax}}$ measures the suppression of the relaxation rate towards a steady state when the system is subject to a local dissipation. We perform both analytical perturbation calculations and exact numerical calculations based on a free fermion chain at the critical point. It is found that $c_{\text{relax}}$ decreases monotonically with the strength of the interface. In particular, $0\le c_{\text{relax}}\le c_{\text{LR}}\le c_{\text{eff}}$, where the equalities hold if and only if the interface is totally reflective or totally transmissive. Our result for $c_{\text{relax}}$ is universal in the sense that $c_{\text{relax}}$ is independent of (i) the dissipation strength in the weak dissipation regime and (ii) the location where the local dissipation is introduced. Comparing to the previously known $c_{\text{LR}}$ and $c_{\text{eff}}$ in a closed system, our $c_{\text{relax}}$ shows a distinct behavior as a function of the interface strength, suggesting its novelty to characterize conformal interfaces in open systems and offering insights into critical systems under dissipation.

Abstract:
We present a new method that efficiently solves TO problems and provides a practical pathway to leverage quantum computing to exploit potential quantum advantages. This work targets on large-scale, multi-material TO challenges for three-dimensional (3D) continuum structures, beyond what have been addressed in prior studies. Central to this new method is the modified Dantzig-Wolfe (MDW) decomposition, which effectively mitigates the escalating computational cost associated with using classical Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solvers to solve the master problems involved in TO, by decomposing the MILP into local and global sub-problems. Evaluated on 3D bridge designs, our classical implementation achieves comparable solution quality to state-of-the-art TO methods while reducing computation time by orders of magnitude. It also maintains low runtimes even in extreme cases where classical MILP solvers fail to converge, such as designs involving over 50 million variables. The computationally intensive local sub-problems, which are essentially Binary Integer Programming (BIP) problems, can potentially be accelerated by quantum computing via their equivalent Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulations. Enabled by the MDW decomposition, the resulting QUBO formulation requires only sparse qubit connectivity and incurs a QUBO construction cost that scales linearly with problem size, potentially accelerating BIP sub-problem solutions by an additional order of magnitude. All observed and estimated speedups become increasingly significant with larger problem sizes and when moving from single-material to multi-material designs. This suggests that this new method, along with quantum computing, will play an increasingly valuable role in addressing the scale and complexity of real-world TO applications.

Abstract:
We present a systematic study of interchannel quantum interference in laser-induced nonsequential double ionization (NSDI) within the strong-field approximation. Focusing on the below-threshold intensity regime where the recollision-excitation with subsequent ionization (RESI) pathway dominates, we derive analytical phase conditions governing interference between distinct excitation channels for arbitrary driving fields. To quantify the interplay between channels resulting from a vast number of interfering processes, we introduce statistical metrics based on the Earth Mover's Distance, allowing us to assess the relative weight of each channel's contribution to the two-electron photoelectron momentum distributions (PMDs). We identify key factors that determine whether interchannel interference is appreciable such as comparable channel intensities, strong spatial overlap between the excited-state wavefunctions and the energy difference between contributing channels. We demonstrate that for linearly polarized few-cycle pulses, the typical intrachannel interference features associated with exchange, temporal shifts and combined exchange-temporal interference are retained with interchannel interference. Our findings establish a hierarchy of interference mechanisms in RESI and may provide practical guidelines for enhancing or suppressing interference in different regions of the momentum plane. The toolkit presented in this work is transferable to a wide range of interferometric schemes involving different excitation channels.

Abstract:
Schrödinger symmetry emerged in a ``fluid limit" from a full superspace to several mini-superspace models. We consider two spherically-symmetric static mini-superspace models with matter fields and verify the robustness of this emergent symmetry at the classical level: (i) Maxwell field with cosmological constant and (ii) $n$ massless scalar fields. We develop a method based on canonical transformations and show that: for model (i), 3D Schrödinger symmetry emerges, and the solution is the (anti-) de Sitter Reissner-Nordström spacetime, and for model (ii), $(2+n)$D Schrödinger symmetry appears, and the solution is a generalized Janis-Newman-Winicour spacetime and its ``interior", a Kantowski-Sachs type closed universe. In the matter decoupling limit, both cases lead to 2D Schrödinger symmetry in different lapse functions and mini-superspace coordinates, which implies the covariance of Schrödinger symmetry. Finally, we propose a physical interpretation of the symmetry under Hamiltonian constraints $H$ and explain it with examples: Symmetry generators commuting with $H$ map a solution to another one, while those non-commuting with $H$ generate a new theory with the Schrödinger symmetry and the transformed configuration is a solution to the new theory. These support the robustness of the emergence of Schrödinger symmetry and open new possibilities for exploring quantum dynamics of matter and gravity based on the symmetry.

Abstract:
Symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in interacting bosonic systems have been widely explored, yet most realizations rely on fine-tuned interactions or enlarged symmetries. Here we show that a qualitatively simpler mechanism--parity order coupled to bond dimerization--acts as a fundamental driver of bosonic topology. Using density matrix renormalization group simulations, we identify two distinct topological phases absent in the purely dimerized model: an SPT phase at half filling stabilized by positive parity coupling, and a topological phase at unit filling stabilized by negative coupling that can be adiabatically connected to a trivial phase without breaking any symmetry. Our results establish parity order as a new organizing principle for correlation-driven bosonic topology.
