Research on clocks has either focused on long-term stability using an oscillator stabilized by a level transition, limiting precision at short timescales, or on making individual stochastic ticks as precise as possible. Here, we prove the viability of a conceptually different avenue: the autonomous self-correction of consecutive ticks by quantum correlations. This provides a new paradigm that integrates the advantages and insights from quantum transport theory to operate clocks at ultra-short timescales. We fully solve a model of coupled quantum systems and show how the emergent Pauli exclusion principle correlates the clock at the quantum level yielding an exponential advantage in precision. We furthermore demonstrate through simulations with realistic imperfections that this remarkable gain in precision remains stable providing a roadmap for implementation with contemporary quantum technologies.", "primary_category": "quant-ph", "categories": ["quant-ph", "cond-mat.stat-mech"], "published": "2026-01-15T19:00:00Z", "updated": "2026-01-15T19:00:00Z", "abs_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10785v1", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.10785v1.pdf"}

Codes such as the rectangular surface code or XZZX code substantially reduce the qubit overhead under biased noise, but they still face challenges. The rectangular surface code suffers from a relatively low threshold, while the XZZX code requires twice as many physical qubits to maintain the same code distance as the surface code. In this work, we introduce a 2D local code construction that outperforms these codes for noise biases $η\\ge 7\\times10^{4}$, reducing the qubit overhead by over 50% at $p_Z=10^{-3}$ and $η= 2 \\times 10^6$ to achieve a logical error rate of $10^{-12}$. Our construction relies on the concatenation of two classical codes. The inner codes are repetition phase-flip codes while the outer codes are high-rate bit-flip codes enabled by their implementation at the logical level, which circumvents device connectivity constraints. These results indicate that under sufficiently biased noise, it is advantageous to address phase-flip and bit-flip errors at different layers of the coding scheme. The inner code should prioritize a high threshold for phase-flip errors, while the bit-flip outer code should optimize for encoding rate efficiency. In the strong biased-noise regime, high-rate outer codes keep the overhead for correcting residual bit-flip errors comparable to that of the repetition code itself, meaningfully lower than that required by earlier approaches.", "primary_category": "quant-ph", "categories": ["quant-ph"], "published": "2026-01-15T19:00:00Z", "updated": "2026-01-15T19:00:00Z", "abs_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10786v1", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.10786v1.pdf"}

Unlike traditional techniques, our implementation is deterministic, does not consume ancilla registers, does not modify the underlying data codes or registers, and is generic over all stabilizer codes. Thus, any single code becomes capable of universal quantum computation by leveraging helper codes in ancilla registers and mid-circuit measurements.

A key contributor to these failures is biological uncertainty, which complicates trial design and weakens the ability to detect true treatment effects. In particular, inadequate patient stratification often results in covariate imbalances across treatment arms, masking treatment effects and reducing statistical power, even when therapies are effective for specific patient subpopulations. This work presents an optimization-based, quantum-enhanced approach to patient stratification that explicitly minimizes covariate imbalance across numerical and categorical variables, without altering protocol design or trial endpoints. Using real clinical trial data, we demonstrate that hybrid quantum-classical optimization methods achieve high-quality stratification while scaling efficiently to larger cohorts. In our benchmark study, the quantum-enhanced pipeline delivered over a 100x improvement in computational efficiency compared to classical approaches, enabling faster iteration and practical deployment at scale. This report shows how improved stratification can lead to decision-relevant gains, including up to a fivefold increase in statistical significance in treatment effect estimation, reducing treatment-effect dilution and increasing trial sensitivity.

With this we explain the symmetry in $R$ and $L$ in the results often observed in the literature and show that the maximal frequency spectrum depends only on the area $A=RL$ and not on the individual values of $R$ and $L$. Moreover, we collect and extend existing results and specify the maximum possible frequency spectrum of a QNN with an arbitrary number of layers as a function of the spectrum of its generators. In the case of arbitrary dimensional generators, where our two introduced notions of maximality differ, we extend existing Golomb ruler based results and introduce a second novel approach based on a variation of the turnpike problem, which we call the relaxed turnpike problem.

In this work, we analyze the quantum computational resource requirements associated with simulating the Schwinger effect under two distinct scenarios: (1) a quench process, where the initial state is a simple product state of a non-interacting theory and then interactions are turned on at time $t=0$, and (2) a splitting (or scattering) process where two Gaussian states, peaked at given initial momenta, are shot away from (or towards) each other.

Although Marcus theory defines the reorganization energy classically, here we show that the reorganization parameter that governs the activation barrier in normal-region electron transfer is most generally a quantum mechanical object that depends on the electronic coupling, coinciding with the Marcus picture when the electronic coupling is small. This result unifies the physical description of electron-transfer activation barriers across the adiabatic and non-adiabatic regimes and formally predicts that Marcus-like rate expressions remain accurate beyond their traditional non-adiabatic domain of validity.

A long-standing open question is to determine the optimal number of uses of an unknown channel required to learn it in diamond distance, the standard metric for distinguishing quantum processes. While the analogous problem of quantum state tomography has been settled over the past decades in both the pure- and mixed-state settings, for general quantum channels it remained largely open beyond the unitary case. Here we design an algorithm showing that any channel with input and output dimensions $d_{\\mathrm{in}},d_{\\mathrm{out}}$ and Kraus rank at most $k$ can be learned to constant accuracy in diamond distance using $Θ(d_{\\mathrm{in}}d_{\\mathrm{out}}k)$ channel uses, and we prove that this scaling is optimal via a matching lower bound. More generally, achieving accuracy $\\varepsilon$ is possible with $O(d_{\\mathrm{in}}d_{\\mathrm{out}}k/\\varepsilon^{2})$ channel uses. Since quantum channels subsume states, unitaries, and isometries as special cases, our protocol provides a unified framework for the corresponding tomography tasks; in particular, it yields the first optimal protocols for isometries and for binary measurement tomography, and it recovers optimal trace-distance tomography for fixed-rank states. Our approach reduces channel tomography to pure-state tomography: we use the channel to prepare copies of its Choi state, purify them in parallel, and run sample-optimal pure-state tomography on the resulting purifications; we then show that the induced diamond-distance error scales essentially linearly with the trace-distance error in estimating the (purified) Choi state. We also resolve an open question by showing that adaptivity does not improve the dimension-optimal query complexity of quantum channel tomography.", "primary_category": "quant-ph", "categories": ["quant-ph", "cs.CC", "cs.DS"], "published": "2025-12-11T02:04:03Z", "updated": "2026-01-16T17:18:38Z", "abs_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10214v2", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10214v2.pdf"}

Our construction encodes a logical qubit in the quantum double $D(G)$ of a non-Abelian group $G$ on a triangular spatial patch. The logical gate is implemented transversally by stacking on the spatial region a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase specified by a group 2-cocycle. The Bravyi--König theorem limits the unitary gates implementable by constant-depth quantum circuits on Pauli stabilizer codes in $D$ dimensions to the $D$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy. We bypass this limitation, by constructing transversal unitary gates at arbitrary levels of the Clifford hierarchy purely in 2D, without sacrificing locality or fault tolerance, at the cost of using the quantum double of a non-Abelian group $G$. Specifically, for $G = D_{4N}$, the dihedral group of order $8N$, we realize the phase gate $T^{1/N} = \\mathrm{diag}(1, e^{iπ/(4N)})$ in the logical $\\overline{Z}$ basis. In this context we propose a non-abelian stabilizer group formalism, which we work out for dihedral groups. For $8N = 2^n$, the logical gate lies at the $n$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy and, importantly, has a qubit-only realization: we show that it can be constructed in terms of Clifford-hierarchy stabilizers for a code with $n$ physical qubits on each edge of the lattice.

While continuum limits of two state quantum walks are well established, an explicit continuous spacetime formulation for the lazy three state walk, particularly including noise, has not previously been constructed. Using an SU(3) representation of a Grover type coin together with a Lindblad formulation of decoherence acting either on the coin or the spatial subspace, we systematically expand the discrete dynamics in both space and time to obtain continuum master equations governing the coarse grained evolution. The resulting generators yield a genuine partial differential equation description of the walk, going beyond purely probabilistic or spectral correspondences. We show that the unitary limit is governed by a Dirac-type SU(3) Hamiltonian describing ballistic advection of left and right moving modes coupled by local symmetric mixing, with the rest state acting as an additional internal degree of freedom. Coin dephasing selectively damps internal coherences while preserving coherent spatial transport, whereas spatial dephasing suppresses long range spatial interference and rapidly drives the dynamics toward classical behaviour.

However, while post-processing of Nb- and Ta-based resonators has been widely explored, primarily focusing on oxide removal using buffered oxide etch (BOE), post-treatment strategies for Al resonators remain underdeveloped. This challenge becomes particularly relevant for industry-scale fabrication with multichip bonding, where delays between sample preparation and cooldown require surface treatments that preserve low dielectric loss during extended exposure to ambient conditions. In this work, we investigate surface modification approaches for Al resonators subjected to a 24-hour delay prior to cryogenic measurement. Passivation using self-limiting oxygen and fluorine chemistries was evaluated utilizing different plasma processes. Remote oxygen plasma treatment reduced dielectric losses, in contrast to direct plasma, likely due to additional ashing of residual resist despite the formation of a thicker oxide layer on both Si and Al surfaces. A fluorine-based plasma process was developed that passivated the Al surface with fluorine for subsequent BOE treatment. However, increasing fluorine incorporation in the aluminum oxide correlated with higher loss, identifying fluorine as an unsuitable passivation material for Al resonators. Finally, selective oxide removal using HF vapor and phosphoric acid was assessed for surface preparation. HF vapor selectively etched SiO2 while preserving Al2O3, whereas phosphoric acid exhibited the opposite selectivity.

A domain-dependent sensitivity emerges under additive-noise evaluation, where the HQNN begins recovery earlier in synthetic data while CNNs recover more steeply and peak higher on real measurements.

In this work, we present the ParaQNN (ParaQuantum neural network) architecture, an equation-free framework for physical discovery.

Yet, standard quantum theory forbids such a unknown-state reflection (no-reflection theorem). We therefore build a state-learning-assisted architecture, called ``amplify-learn,'' which alternates the coherent amplitude amplification with state learning. Embedding this amplify-learn into the Bao-Bouland-Jordan no-signaling framework, we show that the logarithmic-round dream would open a super-luminal communication channel unless each round expends the learning-sample and reflection-circuit budgets scaling at least as $Ω(\\sqrt{N}/\\log N)$. In parallel, we derive tight computational learning-theoretic sample bounds for learning circuit-generated pure states, revealing a state-universal ansatz ``lock'' at order $N$ in the worst case. The dramatic closure is that no-signaling does not merely veto the unphysical primitive, but it fixes the only consistent reflection-circuit complexity, and feeding this causality-enforced complexity into the computational learning bound makes it collapse onto the very same $\\sqrt{N}/\\log N$ scaling demanded by no-signaling alone.

By free, we mean that there is no potential within the interval and that its walls are penetrable; hence, the pertinent energy current density does not vanish at the walls. Certainly, quantization in an interval is not trivial because certain restrictions imposed by the domains of the operators involved arise. Here, our objective is to obtain the Hamiltonian for these particles. In practice, the Feshbach-Villars (FV)--free Hamiltonian is the proper operator for characterizing them and is a function of the momentum operator. Additionally, a Majorana condition must also be imposed on the wavefunctions on which these two operators can act. Thus, we start by calculating the pseudo self-adjoint momentum operator. A three-parameter set of boundary conditions (BCs) constitutes its domain. Up to this point, the domain of the Hamiltonian is induced by the domain of the momentum operator; however, we ensure that only the BCs for which the energy current density has the same value at each end of the interval are in its domain. All these BCs essentially belong to a one-parameter set of BCs. Moreover, because the FV equation is invariant under the operation of parity, the parity-transformed wavefunction is also a solution of this equation, which further restricts the domain of the free FV Hamiltonian. Finally, knowing the most general three-parameter set of BCs for the pseudo self-adjoint FV Hamiltonian for a 1D KFGM particle in an interval, we find that only two BCs can remain within the domain of the FV--free Hamiltonian: the periodic BC and the antiperiodic BC.

In this Letter, we propose a relation between the dynamics of the stabilizer Rényi entropy for thermofield double states and the spectral form factor, based on general arguments for chaotic systems with all-to-all interactions. This relation implies that the saturation of the stabilizer Rényi entropy is governed by a first-order dynamical transition.

Specifically, asymmetric radiation pressure from intrinsic optomechanical nonlinearity induces nonreciprocal mechanical displacement, modulating the cavity intensity through optomechanical feedback. This enables full isolation of backward transmission without requiring parameter initialization. Alternatively, for quantum signals, the platform is reconfigured by activating photonic and phononic exchange channels between the two blocks. In this configuration, nonreciprocity arises from quantum interference between direct photon hopping and indirect conversion pathways. Constructive interference enables unidirectional low-loss transmission, while destructive interference completely suppresses the reverse direction.

In this interferometric framework, we present entropic wave-particle duality relations between quantum coherence, characterized by the relative entropy of coherence of the quanton state, and which-path knowledge, quantified by the mutual information obtained through detector-state discrimination. By applying a general optimal discrimination measurement, which has a closed-form solution and encompasses other fundamental strategies as special cases, we provide an exact quantification of which-path knowledge in a variety of scenarios. This measurement is carried out in two steps. First, an optimal separation map with a prescribed separation level $ξ\\in [0,1]$ probabilistically reduces the overlaps between the input detector states with maximum success rate, or increases them in case of failure. Then, a minimum-error (ME) measurement discriminates either only the successful outputs (standard approach) or both the successful and failure outputs (concatenated approach). We show that the duality relation is tighter at $ξ=0$, where both approaches reduce to the ME measurement. For $ξ>0$, each approach yields a distinct relation that becomes less tight as $ξ$ increases, with the concatenated one providing the tighter bound. Finally, by using the discrete uncertainty principle, we determine the sets of detector states that lead to saturation of the duality relation, showing that they span $n$-dimensional subspaces of the detector space, where $n$ divides $N$. As a result, nontrivial saturation occurs only for interferometers with a nonprime number of paths.

Type-I fusion operates identically to the unweighted case, merging two one-dimensional weighted graphs, while preserving edge weights and success probabilities. In addition, the pool of 2-qubit weighted graph states can be generated easily by GHZ states or Bell pairs. In contrast, Type-II fusion requires a logical qubit, which can be formed only for specific weight configurations, and with success probability below one-half, which is an obstacle one can avoid.

Here, we investigate this limitation and demonstrate that it can be alleviated by integrating the emitters into Fabry-Perot instead of nanophotonic resonators. Their larger optical mode volume enables both increasing the distance to crystal surfaces and operating at a lower dopant concentration, which reduces implantation-induced crystal damage and interactions between emitters.

Using multimode bunching as a reliable criterion of genuine indistinguishability, therefore, requires a clear identification of the interferometric configurations in which anomalous bunching can or cannot occur. In particular, since uncontrolled small time delays between single-photon pulses constitute a common source of mode mismatch in current photonic platforms, it is essential to determine whether the resulting photon distinguishability might lead to anomalous bunching. Here, we first identify a broad class of interferometric configurations in which anomalous bunching is rigorously excluded, thereby establishing regimes where multimode bunching-based validation remains valid. Then, we find that, quite unexpectedly, temporal mode mismatch does not belong to this class.

We prove that in the limiting case this definition corresponds exactly to an extension of noncontextual models that benefits from non-constructive response functions.

The skin effect, induced by non-reciprocal dissipation, localizes relaxation modes near the system boundaries and gives rise to non-orthogonal spectral geometry. While such non-normality is often linked to slow relaxation, we show that it can instead accelerate relaxation through a two-step protocol - realizing a quantum Pontus-Mpemba effect. Specifically, we consider a one-dimensional open chain with coherent hopping $J$, asymmetric incoherent hoppings $J_{\\rm R} \\neq J_{\\rm L}$, and a controllable end-to-end coupling $ε$. For $ε=0$, the system exhibits the Liouvillian skin effect, with left and right eigenmodes localized at opposite edges. We compare two relaxation protocols toward the same stationary state: (i) a direct relaxation with $ε=0$, and (ii) a two-step (Pontus) protocol where a brief coherent evolution transfers the excitation across the lattice before relaxation. Although both share the same asymptotic decay rate, the two-step protocol relaxes significantly faster due to its reduced overlap with the slow boundary-localized Liouvillian mode. The effect disappears when $J_{\\rm R}=J_{\\rm L}$, i.e., when the skin effect vanishes.

We further demonstrate that this equal spacing property extends to local Hamiltonians defined on arbitrary bounded-degree graphs, including regular lattices in any spatial dimension and expander graphs. Hamiltonians with $k$-local interactions and a bounded number of interaction terms per site are also encompassed by our proof. On the same classes of graphs, we additionally establish equal spacing for towers constructed from multi-site quasiparticles on top of product states. For the towers considered here, an immediate corollary of the equal spacing property is that any state initialized entirely within the quantum many-body scar manifold exhibits completely frozen entanglement dynamics under any local Hamiltonian for which those scars are exact eigenstates. Overall, our results reveal a stringent interplay between locality and the structure of quantum many-body scars.", "primary_category": "quant-ph", "categories": ["quant-ph", "cond-mat.stat-mech"], "published": "2026-01-20T18:10:03Z", "updated": "2026-01-20T18:10:03Z", "abs_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14206v1", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.14206v1.pdf"}

Given that quantum phase spaces (QPSs) provide an alternative description of quantum systems, and thus of the group's representation, one may wonder how such harmonic analysis changes. In this work we show that for general compact Lie-group quantum resource theories (QRTs), the entire family of Stratonovich-Weyl quantum phase space representations-characterized by the Cahill-Glauber parameter $s$-has a clear resource-theoretic and signal-processing meaning. Specifically, changing $s$ implements a group Fourier filter that can be continuously tuned to favor low-dimensional irreps where free states have most of their support ($s=-1$), leave the spectrum unchanged ($s=0$), or highlight resourceful, high-dimensional irreps ($s=1$). As such, distinct QPSs constitute veritable group Fourier filters for resources. Moreover, we show that the norms of the QRT's free state Fourier components completely characterize all QPSs. Finally, we uncover an $s$-duality relating the phase space spectra of free states and typical (Haar-random) highly resourceful states through a shift in $s$. Overall, our results provide a new interpretation of QPSs and promote them to a signal-processing framework for diagnosing, filtering, and visualizing quantum resources.", "primary_category": "quant-ph", "categories": ["quant-ph"], "published": "2026-01-20T18:39:23Z", "updated": "2026-01-20T18:39:23Z", "abs_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14225v1", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.14225v1.pdf"}

A remarkable feature of SDP is that the optimization is convex, which allows the problem to be efficiently solved by a variety of numerical algorithms. We have tested several commercially available SDP solvers, all of which allowed for the reconstruction of quantum channels of different forms. A notable feature is that the Kraus rank of the obtained quantum channel typically comprises less than a few percent of its maximal possible value.

We show that the tunneling dynamics of ultracold bosons in a two-dimensional double-well potential offer an alternative pathway for inferring the rotation frequency. Using the mean-field and many-body analyses, we demonstrate that rotation strongly modifies the tunneling time period as well as the momentum and angular momentum dynamics. When the rotation axis passes through the center of the double well, the observables show distinct dynamical responses with increasing rotation frequency, enabling the rotation frequency to be assessed from changes in the tunneling dynamics. When the potential is displaced from the rotation axis, the rotation induces asymmetric tunneling and partial self-trapping, allowing both the rotation frequency and the displacement to be inferred. We further show that for an off-centered double well, the tunneling dynamics exhibit a pronounced orientation dependence, enabling the orientation of the double well to be inferred from the observed dynamics. The many-body analysis further shows that the depletion dynamics are strongly influenced by rotation, providing an additional tool for assessing the rotation frequency. Finally, we study the effect of time-dependent rotation in which the double well is gradually set into motion in the laboratory frame and identify distinct dynamical signatures that depend sensitively on the switching time.

Two conditions are presented to ensure that the left- or right-time derivative of a weak value is also a gauge-invariant weak value. Under these conditions, a local Ehrenfest-like theorem can be derived for weak values giving a natural interpretation for the time derivative of weak values.

Naively mapping circuits to qubits over multiple quantum processing units (QPUs) results in large communication overhead, increasing both execution time and noise. This can be minimised by optimising the assignment of qubits to QPUs and the methods used for covering non-local operations. Formulations that are general enough to capture the spectrum of teleportation possibilities lead to complex problem instances which can be difficult to solve effectively. This highlights a need to exploit the wide range of heuristic techniques used in the graph partitioning literature. This paper formalises and extends existing constructions for graphical quantum circuit partitioning and designs a new objective function that captures further possibilities for non-local operations via nested state teleportation. We adapt the well-known Fiduccia-Mattheyses heuristic to the constraints and problem objective and explore multilevel techniques that coarsen hypergraphs and partition at multiple levels of granularity. We find that this reduces runtime and improves solution quality of standard partitioning. We place these techniques within a larger framework, through which we can extract full distributed quantum circuits including teleportation instructions.

This motion can be decomposed into two parts: the electron's global motion of its inertia (or spin) center and an inherent local periodic motion about this point that produces the electron's spin and has the zitterbewegung frequency found by Schrödinger in his operator analysis of Dirac's wave equation. This zitter motion corresponds to the so-called polarization and magnetization currents in Gordon's decomposition of Dirac's current. In an inertial \"rest\"-frame fixed at the inertia center, Dirac's wave function for a free electron with its spin in a specified direction implies that the zitter motion is a perpetual circular motion about the inertia center in a plane orthogonal to this spin direction with a radius one half of the Compton radius and moving at the speed of light. The electron continuously accelerates about the spin center without any external force because the inertia is effective at the spin center, rather than at its charge center where the electron interacts with the electro-magnetic field. This analysis confirms the nature of zitterbewegung directly from Dirac's wave equation, agreeing with the conclusions of Barut and Zanghi, Beck, Hestenes, Rivas and Salesi from their classical Dirac particle models of the electron.

In this scenario, we first propose a linear witness to detect triangle network swap-steering.

We then derive a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) reformulation, which is frequently used as input for quantum optimization, and evaluate its solutions using quantum annealing on D-Wave Advantage systems and the classical quantum-inspired VeloxQ solver. Computational experiments on real-world instances from the Silesian network, with up to 404 train trips and 11 EMU types, show that the ILP approach can obtain high-quality daily circulation plans within at most about 40 minutes. In contrast, current quantum and quantum-inspired solvers are restricted to substantially smaller subinstances (up to 51 and 78 train trips, respectively) due to the large number of terms in the QUBO and, in the case of quantum hardware, embedding limitations. These results quantify the current frontier of QUBO-based methods for rolling stock circulation and point toward hybrid decision-support architectures in which quantum or quantum-inspired optimizers address only local subproblems within a broader classical planning framework.", "primary_category": "quant-ph", "categories": ["quant-ph"], "published": "2025-12-22T12:36:20Z", "updated": "2026-01-20T12:17:55Z", "abs_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19340v2", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19340v2.pdf"}

In QIA, operators are expressed as structured combinations of basis elements indexed by Boolean codes, allowing products, commutators, and conjugations to be computed through finite rules on discrete indices rather than through dense matrix arithmetic. This representation unifies combinatorial index structure, explicit matrix realization, and transformation properties under Walsh-Hadamard-type transforms within a single formalism. Using QIA and its associated block-matrix realization, we reformulate the Bernstein-Vazirani hidden-string problem in its phase-oracle form entirely within a real, finite-dimensional algebraic setting. We show that, under structured oracle access, the QIA procedure reproduces the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm exactly and achieves the same asymptotic query complexity and circuit depth as the standard quantum algorithm. In particular, the hidden string is recovered by symbolic manipulation of a sparse algebraic representation of the oracle rather than by numerical simulation of quantum amplitudes. Our results demonstrate that the apparent quantum speed-up in this setting is a consequence of operator structure rather than Hilbert-space dimensionality alone. QIA thus provides a precise language for separating genuinely quantum resources from those arising from algebraic and combinatorial structures and offers a new perspective on the classical simulability of structured quantum circuits.", "primary_category": "quant-ph", "categories": ["quant-ph"], "published": "2025-12-23T01:58:02Z", "updated": "2026-01-17T09:40:39Z", "abs_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19977v2", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19977v2.pdf"}

The potential of the resulting cluster solver is demonstrated by computing the self-energy functional for the single-band Hubbard model at half filling in the strongly correlated regime, on different cluster geometries.

Treating clusters sizes with up to $6\\times 6$ sites we obtain significant improvement over the extrapolation accessible with exact diagonalization solvers when comparing to quantum Monte Carlo results.

This new channel manifests itself as anomalous, temperature-independent spin relaxation, which can be suppressed by high magnetic fields or pore-filling solvents (e.g. CH2Cl2, CS2). Such field- and guest-tunable relaxation is unattainable in conventional spin systems. Harnessing this mechanism could boost repetition rates in spin-based quantum information technologies without compromising coherence or quantum sensing performance.", "primary_category": "cond-mat.mes-hall", "categories": ["cond-mat.mes-hall", "physics.chem-ph", "quant-ph"], "published": "2025-06-05T11:03:51Z", "updated": "2026-01-20T17:18:56Z", "abs_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04885v2", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04885v2.pdf"}

Guzman", "Leandro Aolita"], "abstract": "Numerical simulations of turbulent fluids are paramount to real-life applications, from predicting and modeling flows to diagnostic purposes in engineering. However, they are also computationally challenging due to their intrinsically non-linear dynamics, which require a very high spatial resolution to accurately describe them. A promising idea is to represent flows on a discrete mesh using tensor trains (TTs), featuring a convenient scaling of the number of parameters with the mesh size. However, it is unclear how the compression power of TTs is affected by the complexity of the flows, as measured by the Reynolds number. In fact, no comprehensive analysis of how the TT representation affects the turbulent properties has yet been carried out. We fill this gap by analyzing TTs as an Ansatz to compress, simulate, and generate 3D snapshots with turbulent-like features. Specifically, we first investigate the effect of TT compression on key turbulence signatures, such as the energy spectrum, the PDF of velocity increments, and flatness. Second, we extend the 2D TT-solver introduced in [1] to a 3D cubic domain with periodic boundary conditions. We use it to simulate the incompressible Navier-Stokes dynamics at $Re_λ=315$ for a total of 9-10 Kolmogorov turnover times, showcasing the numerical stability of the TT-solver in fully developed turbulent regimes. Third, we develop a TT algorithm to synthesize artificial snapshots that exhibit turbulent-like features, with a logarithmic cost in the mesh size. Our analysis demonstrates the ability of the TT representation to capture the characteristic features of turbulence.

This picture suffers from two well-known weaknesses. First, it assumes that quantum field theory remains valid at trans-Planckian scales, without modifications from quantum gravity. Second, it necessitates a quantum-to-classical transition in which fluctuations of a homogeneous quantum state become the classical inhomogeneities seen in the CMB. Recently, an alternative paradigm has been proposed in which such inhomogeneities are present from the very beginning, emerging from the assumed discreteness of spacetime at the Planck scale predicted by certain approaches to quantum gravity. Within this framework, scale-invariant scalar perturbations are generated naturally, without relying on trans-Planckian assumptions or invoking a quantum-to-classical transition. Specifically, inhomogeneities in the quantum state at the Planck scale propagate into semiclassical inhomogeneities on CMB scales.
